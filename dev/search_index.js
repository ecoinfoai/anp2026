Spermatogonia are diploid cells that produce mature haploid gametes through meiosis.\n\nMeiotic Process: Meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions:\n\nIn the first meiotic division, DNA is replicated and homologous chromosomes separate into two daughter cells, each containing 23 chromosomes (haploid)\nEach of the 23 chromosomes consists of identical DNA sister chromatids\nDuring the second meiotic division, the sister chromatids separate, resulting in four haploid cells from one diploid spermatogonium\n\nContinuous Production: From 1,000 to 2,000 stem cells migrate from the yolk sac to the fetal testis. To produce numerous sperm throughout life, spermatogonia are replicated through mitosis, and one becomes a primary spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte) undergoing meiosis. This ensures spermatogonia numbers remain constant.\n\nStages of Sperm Development:\n\nPrimary Spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte): A diploid cell that completes the first meiotic division to form two haploid secondary spermatocytes (secondary spermatocyte)\nSecondary Spermatocyte (secondary spermatocyte): A haploid cell that undergoes the second meiotic division to form a haploid spermatid (spermatid). Thus, one primary spermatocyte produces four spermatids\nSpermatid to Mature Sperm: The four spermatids resulting from meiosis remain interconnected—their cytoplasm does not completely separate. The process of these interconnected spermatids developing into fully mature sperm (spermatozoa) is called sperm metamorphosis (metamorphosis), which requires the action of sustentacular cells (Sertoli cells)\n\nSex Determination: The sex of offspring is determined by sperm. Male somatic cells contain XY chromosomes, while female somatic cells contain XX chromosomes. Through meiosis, ova reduce their chromosome number but contain only X chromosomes. When an ovum is fertilized by sperm carrying an X chromosome, the fertilized ovum becomes XX (female); when fertilized by sperm carrying a Y chromosome, it becomes XY (male).","category":"section"},{"location":"summary_en/Ch12_ReproductionDevelopment_Summary_EN/#(2)-Sperm-(Sperm)","page":"Ch12.

The testicular spermatogonia number does not significantly decrease, so sperm production capacity remains undiminished. In the epididymis, sperm acquire motility and undergo other maturational changes.

Sensory System","title":"Properties of Sensation","text":"Adequate stimulus and inadequate stimulus: Each sensory organ responds specifically to its appropriate stimulus (adequate stimulus). Other types of stimuli are called inadequate stimuli. However, high-intensity inadequate stimuli can still stimulate sensory receptors and produce the same type of sensation as the adequate stimulus.\n\nLaw of specific nerve energies: When strong inadequate stimuli are applied to a sensory organ, they produce the same type of sensation as the adequate stimulus. For example, mechanical pressure on the eye produces the sensation of light, not pressure.\n\nAdaptation: When a constant-strength stimulus is applied for a prolonged duration, the subjective sensation gradually decreases over time. The firing frequency of sensory receptors diminishes progressively until reaching a fixed value or ceasing entirely. Tactile sensation adapts most rapidly, while vestibular proprioceptive sensation adapts very slowly.\n\nLaw of projection: Stimuli applied to the body are ultimately processed by sensory centers in the cerebral cortex, but we feel sensations in the body area where the stimulus is applied or in external space, not in the brain itself. This projection ability can be refined through practice.\n\nWeber's law: The minimum change in stimulus intensity that produces a noticeable difference in sensation (discrimination threshold) is proportional to the original stimulus intensity. Mathematically expressed as: ΔR/R = K (where K is a constant).\n\n","category":"section"},{"location":"summary_en/Ch14_SensorySystem_Summary_EN/#2.-Visual-Organ","page":"Ch14.
