# Chapter 01. Introduction

## 1. Anatomy and Physiology

### Overview
- **Physiology**: A discipline that studies the functions, properties, and mechanisms of each organ in the living body, including the physical and chemical factors and processes within them.
- **Anatomy**: A discipline that reveals the structure and form of the human body; it is morphology of the human body.

### Anatomy
- **Etymology**: A compound of Latin 'ana' and 'tomy', meaning 'cutting' or 'analysis' in English.
- **Human anatomy**: The most fundamental discipline in medicine, providing knowledge about the structure, form, and position of organs and tissues in each body region.

### History of Anatomy
- **Hippocrates (B.C. 460–377)**: First used the term 'anatomy'
- **Erasistratos (B.C. 292–201)**: First attempted human dissection
- **Galenus (130–201)**: Systematically dissected monkeys; his theory dominated until the 15th century
- **Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564)**: Published 『De Humani Corporis Fabrica』 in 1543; known as the 'Father of Modern Anatomy'

### Classification of Anatomy
- **By research method**:
  - Gross anatomy (macroscopic anatomy): Observes each body part with the naked eye using various instruments
  - Microscopic anatomy: Uses microscopes to observe and study the fine structure and form of cells and tissues
  - Embryology: Observes and studies the process from fertilized egg to growth of an individual
- **By research purpose**:
  - Systemic anatomy: The most fundamental discipline of anatomy; observes human organs by dividing them into systematic groups
  - Pathological anatomy: A discipline for investigating the cause of disease or death
  - Forensic anatomy: A discipline for determining the cause of death through forensic anatomical investigation

### Physiology
- **Etymology**: Derived from Latin; 'physio' (nature) + 'logy' (science)
- **Definition**: A discipline that studies the functions, properties, and mechanisms of living organisms
- **History**:
  - Erasistratus (B.C. 292–201): Attempted to apply physical laws to the study of human body function; called the 'Father of Physiology'
  - Galenus (130–201): Recognized as the supreme authority in physiology until the Renaissance
  - William Harvey (1578–1657): Discovered the principle of blood circulation — that the heart pumps blood through closed vessels
  - Claude Bernard (1813–1878): 'Father of Modern Physiology'; stated that "the internal environment maintains a remarkable constancy despite changes in the external environment"
  - Walter Cannon (1871–1945): Named this constancy of the internal environment "homeostasis" in his book 『The Wisdom of the Body』
- **Classification**: Plant physiology, animal physiology, bacterial physiology, virus physiology, cellular physiology, human physiology

## 2. Overview of the Human Body

### Characteristics of Humans
- Belong to mammals (mammalia), the most evolved among vertebrates.
- Compared to other mammals, humans have very little body hair and a highly developed cerebrum.

### Anatomical Terminology

#### Anatomical Position
- Standing upright, eyes facing forward horizontally, arms hanging at the sides with palms facing forward, fingers extended straight

#### Body Planes
- **Midsagittal plane**: Passes through the sagittal suture of the skull; divides the body equally into left and right halves
- **Sagittal plane**: Parallel to the midsagittal plane; divides the body or organs into left and right portions
- **Frontal plane (coronal plane)**: Parallel to the forehead; divides the body or organs into anterior and posterior portions
- **Transverse plane (horizontal plane)**: Divides the body into superior and inferior portions; horizontal to the ground

#### Directional Terms
- **Anterior (ventral)**: Front side of the body or organ
- **Posterior (dorsal)**: Back side of the body or organ
- **Superior (cranial)**: Upper direction in standing position
- **Inferior (caudal)**: Lower direction in standing position
- **Medial**: Closer to the midsagittal plane; ulnar (arm), tibial (leg)
- **Lateral**: Farther from the midsagittal plane; radial (arm), fibular (leg)
- **Proximal**: Closer to the center of the body
- **Distal**: Farther from the center of the body
- **Parietal**: Wall side of a body cavity
- **Visceral**: Organ side of a body cavity
- **Superficial (external)**: Closer to the surface of the body or organ
- **Deep (internal)**: Deeper from the surface of the body or organ

### Body Cavities
- The human body has 5 body cavities.
- **Cranial cavity**: Enclosed by the skull (cranium); contains the brain; communicates with the vertebral canal through the foramen magnum
- **Vertebral canal**: Formed by the continuous alignment of vertebral foramina; contains the spinal cord
- **Thoracic cavity**: Enclosed by the thoracic cage (rib cage); contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, lungs, and great vessels; separated from abdominal cavity by the diaphragm
- **Abdominal cavity**: Enclosed by the abdominal wall; contains most digestive organs, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, intestines, spleen
- **Pelvic cavity**: Contains the urinary bladder, rectum, and internal reproductive organs

### Structural Levels of the Body
- Chemical level: atoms → molecules → macromolecules
- Cellular level: cell — the basic unit of structure, function, and heredity; diameter 10–20 μm (lymphocyte 5 μm – nerve cell 1 mm)
- Tissue level: groups of similarly differentiated cells with similar structure and function; 4 primary tissues = epithelial, connective, nervous, muscle tissue
- Organ level: tissues combined appropriately to perform specific functions
  - Parenchymal organs: solid organs (liver, pancreas, kidney, thyroid gland)
  - Hollow organs: organs with empty interior (stomach, esophagus, intestine, bladder, uterus)
- Organ system level: organs working together for a common purpose; 11 organ systems
- Organism level: the complete individual

### Organ Systems (11 Systems)
- **Integumentary**: Skin, hair, nails, sweat glands, sebaceous glands → tissue protection, temperature regulation, sensory receptor support
- **Skeletal**: Bones, ligaments, cartilage, tendons → structural framework, soft tissue protection, muscle attachment, blood cell production, mineral storage
- **Muscular**: Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, visceral muscle → movement, posture maintenance, heat generation
- **Nervous**: Brain, spinal cord, nerves, sensory organs → detecting changes, receiving and interpreting sensory information, stimulating muscles and glands
- **Endocrine**: Hormone-secreting glands (pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas, ovaries, testes, pineal gland, thymus) → metabolic regulation
- **Cardiovascular**: Heart, arteries, veins, capillaries, blood → blood movement through vessels and substance transport
- **Lymphatic**: Lymph vessels, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen → tissue fluid return to blood, absorbed nutrient transport, body defense
- **Digestive**: Mouth, tongue, teeth, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine → food intake, breakdown, absorption
- **Respiratory**: Nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs → air passage, gas respiration, gas exchange
- **Urinary**: Kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra → waste removal from blood, water and electrolyte balance
- **Reproductive**: Male (scrotum, prostate, urethra, penis), Female (ovaries, uterine tubes, uterus, vagina) → gamete production, fetal development

### Body Fluids
- Total body water: approximately 60% of adult male body weight (adult female 51%, newborn 70%)
- **Intracellular fluid (ICF)**: Fluid inside cells; comprises approximately 2/3 of total body fluid
- **Extracellular fluid (ECF)**: Fluid outside cells; comprises remaining 1/3
  - Blood: fluid within blood vessels
  - Lymph: fluid within lymphatic vessels
  - Interstitial fluid (ISF) / Tissue fluid (TF): fluid between cells
- Cells are surrounded by tissue fluid, absorbing O₂ and nutrients, and releasing metabolic products
- Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Cl⁻ are mostly abundant in extracellular fluid; K⁺, Mg²⁺, protein are mostly abundant in intracellular fluid
- Protein is abundant in plasma but very scarce in interstitial fluid

## 3. Homeostasis

### Concept of Internal Environment
- Only skin and mucosal cells are in direct contact with the external air and water; other cells exist in extracellular fluid (body fluid)
- Extracellular fluid is the living environment for nearly all cells, hence called the **internal environment**
- Osmotic pressure, pH, electrolyte composition, gas composition, and body temperature must be maintained at optimal conditions

### History of Homeostasis
- **Claude Bernard**: 19th-century French physiologist who first proposed the concept of internal environment; "Life phenomena appear in diverse forms, but ultimately have the sole purpose of maintaining homeostasis of the internal environment"
- **Walter B. Cannon**: Advanced Bernard's theory and coined the term **homeostasis**; derived from Greek Homeo (same) + stasis (staying); also called 'purposefulness'

### Homeostatic Control Mechanisms
- **Receptor (sensor)**: Detects deviations from the set point
- **Integrating center**: Usually the brain or spinal cord, but can also be endocrine gland cells; measures the relative intensity of sensory input
- **Effector**: Responds by increasing or decreasing the activity of muscles or glands
- Cell and organ functions are controlled by the nervous system and the endocrine system

### Negative Feedback
- **Definition**: When a substance or condition in the body increases (or rises) quantitatively, the increased factor acts directly or indirectly on the regulatory organ to decrease it, returning to the original state; and vice versa
- Deviation from set point → receptor detection → transmission to integrating center → effector response (opposite direction) → return to original state
- Homeostasis can be regarded as a state of **dynamic constancy**
- Example: When body temperature exceeds the 37°C set point, brain receptors detect the deviation → promote sweat gland activity; when temperature drops → shivering raises body temperature

### Positive Feedback
- **Definition**: A phenomenon where the initial stimulus triggers a response that further amplifies the magnitude of the next stimulus; the effector's action amplifies the change that stimulated it
- Ultimately, homeostasis must be maintained by negative feedback rather than positive feedback mechanisms
- Examples: Blood coagulation (multi-stage positive feedback activation of clotting factors), urination (increased urination after initiation), labor contractions (uterine contractions become more frequent and stronger after initiation)
