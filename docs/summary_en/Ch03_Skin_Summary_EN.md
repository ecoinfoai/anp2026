# Chapter 03. Skin

## Overview
- **Skin**: A tough membrane covering the entire body surface that provides body protection, temperature regulation, metabolism, and fat storage
- Surface area: 1.6–1.8 m² in adults; weight approximately 4.0 kg
- Functions: ① Body protection ② Temperature regulation ③ Excretion of water, lipids, etc. ④ Detection of touch, thermal sensations, and pain ⑤ Absorption of drugs ⑥ Vitamin D storage
- Skin color: Determined by pigments (keratohyalin, melanin) and capillary distribution
- Mongolian spot: Blue spots on newborns' backs (especially buttocks); disappear with growth

## 1. Structure of the Skin

### Layer Structure
- Skin consists of **epidermis** and **dermis**, with **subcutaneous tissue** beneath
- Thickness: average 1–4 mm
- Thick on palms and soles; thin on eyelids, ear pinnae, penis, scrotum

### 1) Epidermis
- Outermost layer; stratified squamous epithelium
- Thickness: palms/soles 0.8–1.4 mm; other areas 0.07–0.12 mm
- Layers (inside to outside): Germinative layer (basal + spinous) → Granular layer → Clear layer → Cornified layer
- Epidermis renews every 25–45 days
- Epidermis has **no blood vessels**

#### (1) Cornified Layer (Stratum Corneum)
- Dead squamous epithelial cells; keratinized thick layer; no nuclei; filled with keratin
- Keratin: exceptionally tough fibrous protein; prevents moisture loss; resists biological, physical, and chemical attacks
- Continuously shed and replaced by basal layer cell division

#### (2) Clear Layer (Stratum Lucidum)
- Thin transparent layer below cornified layer
- Contains eleidin, a semi-fluid substance

#### (3) Granular Layer (Stratum Granulosum)
- 3–5 layers of spindle-shaped cells below clear layer
- Nuclei clearly visible (unlike cornified and clear layers)
- Contains irregular granules of keratohyalin

#### (4) Germinative Layer
- Deepest layer of epidermis; divided into 2 sublayers
- **Spinous layer (stratum spinosum)**: Polygonal cells with short spiny projections forming intercellular bridges
- **Basal layer (stratum basale)**: Single-layered columnar epithelium; continuously divides producing millions of cells daily; contains melanin pigment granules determining skin color; closest to dermis; receives nutrients via diffusion from dermis

### 2) Dermis
- Connective tissue layer below epidermis; rich in elastic fibers, blood vessels, and nerves
- Thickness: approximately 0.3–3 mm
- Divided into vascular papilla and nervous papilla
- Rich blood supply maintains body temperature homeostasis
- Divided into papillary layer and reticular layer

#### (1) Papillary Layer
- Surface layer of dermis; forms ridges and grooves on skin surface
- Dermal papillae: finger-like projections protruding into epidermis
- Contains capillary loops supplying oxygen and nutrients to epidermis
- Contains pain receptors (free nerve endings) and Meissner's corpuscles (touch receptors)
- On palms and soles: papillae arranged in clear patterns → increases friction → fingerprints
- Papillary patterns are genetically determined

#### (2) Reticular Layer
- Deepest skin layer
- Composed of collagen fibers and elastic fibers
- Contains blood vessels, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and Pacinian corpuscles (deep pressure receptors)
- Macrophages prevent bacterial invasion
- Aging reduces collagen and elastic fibers → wrinkles
- **Langer's lines**: Incisions parallel to these lines produce smaller wounds; perpendicular incisions produce larger wounds

### 3) Subcutaneous Tissue
- Loose connective tissue binding skin to underlying fascia
- Well-developed blood vessels and lymphatic vessels in network pattern
- Rich in fat cells → also called subcutaneous fat layer
- Fat tissue acts as heat insulator for temperature regulation
- Well-developed in abdomen and buttocks (≥3 cm thick); more developed in females
- Absent in eyelids, penis, scrotum, ear pinnae

### 4) Nerve Endings of the Skin
- Free nerve ending: pain; Meissner's corpuscle: touch; Ruffini body: warmth; Krause's end-bulb: cold; Pacinian corpuscle: pressure
- Muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ: proprioceptors for deep sensation

### 5) Blood Vessels of the Skin
- Supply nutrients and regulate body temperature
- Arteriovenous anastomoses present
- Blood flow can vary up to 100-fold: 20–50 mL/min (constricted) to 2–5 L/min (fully dilated)
- Vascular regulation occurs reflexively via sympathetic nerves

## 2. Skin Appendages

- Include: skin glands (sweat glands, sebaceous glands, mammary glands), hair and follicles, nails
- All appendages originate from the **dermis**

### 1) Hair
- Tough keratinized product of epidermis on body surface
- Functions: protection, temperature preservation, touch sensation
- Hair shaft (above skin); Hair root (within skin)
- Color determined by melanin content
- Hair grows from hair papilla; head hair grows approximately 1.5–2.0 cm per month

### 2) Sebaceous Glands
- Located in dermis continuous with hair follicles; monoalveolar glands
- Sebum contains fat, cholesterol, albumin, salts; prevents hair drying and excessive moisture evaporation
- **Arrector pili muscle (piloerector muscle)**: Contraction causes goose skin; absent in eyebrows, eyelashes, ear hair, armpit hair
- Arrector pili muscle innervated by sympathetic nerves

### 3) Nails
- Keratinized epidermis of dorsal fingers and toes; protective function
- Nail body and nail root; matrix unguis responsible for nail growth
- Nails appear pink due to rich blood supply in underlying dermis

### 4) Sweat Glands
- Over 2.5 million per person
- **Eccrine glands (small sweat glands)**: Distributed throughout body; coiled tubular glands
  - Sweat: clear secretion containing water, NaCl, vitamin C, metabolic waste (ammonia, urea, uric acid), lactic acid
  - Acidic (pH 4–6); inhibits bacterial growth
  - Important for thermoregulation and excretion
- **Apocrine glands (large sweat glands)**: Found only in axillae, nipples, eyelids, external auditory canal, genital area, perianal area
  - Larger than eccrine glands; ducts open into hair follicles
  - Secretion: milky or yellowish; contains fatty acids and proteins
  - Activated at puberty by male hormones; minimal role in thermoregulation
  - Cause of osmidrosis (body odor)

### 5) Mammary Glands
- Modified sweat glands in adult female breast
- Located above pectoralis major fascia, at 2nd–6th(7th) rib level; left breast slightly larger
- Nipple has 12–15 openings of lactiferous ducts
- Areola darkens during pregnancy/postpartum
- Internal structure: 15–20 lactiferous lobes arranged radially → lactiferous ducts → lactiferous sinuses → nipple openings
- Breast weight: 150–200 g; during lactation 400–500 g
- Breast size determined by fat amount, not glandular tissue → size and milk production are largely unrelated

## 3. Burns

- Burns: skin damage from heat, hot liquids, steam, chemicals, electricity, UV radiation
- Classified into 3 degrees by damage severity

### Burn Degrees
- **1st degree**: Epidermis only; redness; no scarring; heals in 2–3 days; includes sunburn
- **2nd degree**: Epidermis and dermis; pain and blisters; epithelial regeneration possible; no permanent scarring if infection prevented
- **3rd degree**: Through epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, and fascia; glands and follicles cannot regenerate; severe scarring; requires skin graft surgery

### Burn Complications
- Fluid loss (protein and electrolyte-containing) through burned surfaces
- Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, renal failure, circulatory shock possible
- **Rule of nines**: Body divided into 11 regions (each 9% of body surface area); remaining 1% is genital/perineal area
- Severe burn criteria: >25% 2nd degree, >10% 3rd degree, 3rd degree on face or hands/feet

## 4. Body Temperature

### Thermoregulation Animals
- **Poikilothermal (cold-blooded)**: Body temperature varies with environment
- **Homeothermal (warm-blooded)**: Body temperature relatively constant

### Human Body Temperature
- Varies by body region; extremities fluctuate with environmental temperature
- Core temperature is nearly constant
- Oral measurement: 37.0°C; Rectal measurement: 0.6°C higher than oral
- Lowest at 6–7 AM, highest at 6–7 PM (difference ~1°C)
- Children approximately 1°C higher than adults
- Temperature maintained when heat production = heat loss

### 1) Heat Production
- Major heat-producing organs: liver, heart, brain, and all endocrine glands → approximately 50% of body heat
- Skeletal muscles (comprising ~1/2 of body volume) → approximately 40% of heat

### 2) Heat Loss
- Occurs through radiation, conduction, and evaporation
- **Radiation**: Infrared exchange between body and surrounding objects; ~60% of heat loss at 21°C nude
- **Conduction**: Heat transfer to objects in contact; ~3% to solid objects, ~12% to air
- **Convection**: Heated air rises, replaced by cooler air; essentially a result of conduction
- **Evaporation**: Water changing to gas state; 0.58 kcal lost per gram of water evaporated; ~25% of heat loss; daily evaporation ~600 mL
- As ambient temperature approaches body temperature, evaporation proportion increases (75% at 31°C)

### 3) Thermoregulation
- Central control: **hypothalamus**
- When temperature rises: **anterior hypothalamus** neurons excited → skin vasodilation, increased sweating, decreased muscle tone → increased heat loss, decreased heat production
- When temperature falls: **skin thermoreceptors** → **posterior hypothalamus** neurons excited → skin vasoconstriction, decreased sweating, increased skeletal muscle tone, shivering → decreased heat loss, increased heat production
- Hypothalamus functions like a thermostat set at 37°C in healthy individuals

### 4) Fever
- Core temperature (rectal) elevated above 38°C
- Caused by exogenous pyrogens (bacterial infection, allergies, cancer) raising the thermoregulatory set point; thermoregulation mechanism itself is intact
- Also caused by mechanical stimuli (cerebral hemorrhage, brain tumor, skull base fracture) and pyrogens
- Defervescence: When cause is removed, set point returns to normal → vasodilation and sweating → heat loss promoted
- Antipyretics: Aspirin inhibits prostaglandin synthesis → reduces fever
