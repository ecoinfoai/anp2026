# Chapter 14. Sensory System

## 1. Characteristics of Sensation

### Types of Sensation

Sensory organs (sensory receptors) receive physical and chemical stimuli from the external environment. Sensations are classified into several categories:

- **Special sensation**: Visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and vestibular sensations (transmitted via cranial nerves)
- **Somatic sensation**:
  - Superficial sensation: Touch, pressure, warm, cold, pain sensations from skin and mucous membranes
  - Deep sensation (proprioception): Sensations from muscles, tendons, and joints
- **Visceral sensation**: Hunger, thirst, nausea, visceral pain, and other internal organ sensations (transmitted via autonomic nervous system)

### Properties of Sensation

**Adequate stimulus and inadequate stimulus**: Each sensory organ responds specifically to its appropriate stimulus (adequate stimulus). Other types of stimuli are called inadequate stimuli. However, high-intensity inadequate stimuli can still stimulate sensory receptors and produce the same type of sensation as the adequate stimulus.

**Law of specific nerve energies**: When strong inadequate stimuli are applied to a sensory organ, they produce the same type of sensation as the adequate stimulus. For example, mechanical pressure on the eye produces the sensation of light, not pressure.

**Adaptation**: When a constant-strength stimulus is applied for a prolonged duration, the subjective sensation gradually decreases over time. The firing frequency of sensory receptors diminishes progressively until reaching a fixed value or ceasing entirely. Tactile sensation adapts most rapidly, while vestibular proprioceptive sensation adapts very slowly.

**Law of projection**: Stimuli applied to the body are ultimately processed by sensory centers in the cerebral cortex, but we feel sensations in the body area where the stimulus is applied or in external space, not in the brain itself. This projection ability can be refined through practice.

**Weber's law**: The minimum change in stimulus intensity that produces a noticeable difference in sensation (discrimination threshold) is proportional to the original stimulus intensity. Mathematically expressed as: ΔR/R = K (where K is a constant).

## 2. Visual Organ

### Eyeball Structure

The eyeball is a spherical structure approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, located within the orbit. The visual (optical) axis passes through the optical centers of refractive elements: cornea → lens → vitreous body.

**External wall of eyeball (outer layer - fibrous tunic)**:
- **Cornea**: Transparent, convex, and colorless structure covering the anterior eyeball. Refracts incoming light rays and contributes to focusing light onto the retina. Highly sensitive to foreign materials; thickness approximately 1 mm; no blood vessels
- **Sclera**: White, opaque portion of the eyeball; forms 5/6 of the fibrous tunic; provides protective and supportive functions; attachment point for extraocular muscles

**Middle coat (vascular tunic)**:
- **Choroid**: Dark thin membrane rich in blood vessels and pigment cells; provides nutrition to the retina and absorbs scattered light
- **Ciliary body**: Located between choroid and iris; contains ciliary muscle (smooth muscle); controls lens thickness for accommodation; produces aqueous humor; innervated by oculomotor nerve
- **Iris**: Thin membrane between cornea and lens; regulates amount of light entering eyeball through pupil dilation and constriction; sphincter pupillae muscle (parasympathetic control) → constricts pupil; dilator pupillae muscle (sympathetic control) → dilates pupil

**Inner layer (sensory layer - retina)**:
- **Retina**: Light-sensitive receptor layer; thickness 0.5-1 mm; contains layers including pigment epithelium, photoreceptor layer (rods and cones), bipolar cell layer, ganglion cell layer, and nerve fiber layer
- **Photoreceptors** → **Bipolar cells** → **Ganglion cells** → **Optic nerve**
- **Rod cells (approximately 120 million per eye)**:
  - Contain visual purple (rhodopsin)
  - Highly sensitive to low light intensity
  - Function in dim light conditions (night vision)
  - Cannot distinguish color; located peripherally
- **Cone cells (approximately 7 million per eye)**:
  - Contain iodopsin
  - Less sensitive to light; require bright light
  - Function in daylight vision (photopic vision)
  - Essential for color vision and visual acuity
  - Concentrated in fovea centralis (central fovea); absent from fovea
- **Macula**: Most sensitive area of retina; contains only cone cells
- **Fovea centralis (central pit)**: Area of sharpest vision; contains only cone cells; no rod cells
- **Optic disc (optic nerve head)**: Approximately 1.5 mm diameter; contains no photoreceptors; forms the blind spot

### Contents of the Eyeball

**Lens (crystalline lens)**:
- Convex, colorless, transparent structure; diameter approximately 9 mm
- Located posterior to pupil
- Refracts light and focuses it onto retina
- Connected to ciliary body by suspensory ligament (zonule of Zinn)
- Supports accommodation (adjustment of lens shape to focus light at various distances)
- Opacification of lens causes cataract

**Vitreous body (gel-like, clear substance)**:
- Colorless, transparent gel-like semifluid substance
- Fills space between lens and retina
- Maintains spherical shape of eyeball
- Maintains intraocular pressure
- Allows light to pass through to retina
- Intraocular pressure maintained at 20-30 mm Hg

**Aqueous humor (clear fluid)**:
- Located in anterior and posterior chambers
- Anterior chamber: Space between cornea and iris
- Posterior chamber: Space between iris, ciliary body, and lens
- Maintains intraocular pressure
- Provides nutrition to lens and cornea
- Excessive aqueous humor buildup causes glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure)

### Accessory Structures of the Eye

**Extraocular muscles (6 muscles)**:
- **Superior rectus muscle** (CN III - oculomotor)
- **Inferior rectus muscle** (CN III)
- **Medial rectus muscle** (CN III)
- **Lateral rectus muscle** (CN VI - abducens)
- **Superior oblique muscle** (CN IV - trochlear)
- **Inferior oblique muscle** (CN III)
- **Levator palpebrae superioris** (CN III)
- All muscles except inferior oblique originate from common tendinous ring around optic nerve

**Eyelids**:
- Pair of movable, folded skin structures protecting the eye
- Control light passage, protect cornea, clean corneal surface
- Palpebral fissure: Space between upper and lower eyelids
- Medial (nasal) canthus and lateral (temporal) canthus: Points where upper and lower lids meet
- Eyelashes on free margin of eyelids
- Eyebrow above upper eyelid
- Eyelid contains meibomian glands (tarsal glands) secreting lipid material

**Conjunctiva**:
- Mucous membrane connecting eyeball and eyelids
- Forms continuous sac bounded by palpebral fissure
- Palpebral conjunctiva: Covers inner surface of eyelids
- Bulbar conjunctiva: Covers anterior sclera
- Conjunctival fornices: Recesses where superior and inferior conjunctiva transition (site where dust and debris collect)
- Contains goblet cells secreting mucus
- Highly vascular and sensitive; innervated by ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve (CN V1)
- Conjunctival reflex (rapid eyelid closure upon conjunctival contact) is protective response
- Contains lacrimal caruncle and semilunar fold

**Lacrimal apparatus**:
- Lacrimal gland: Small, flat gland located superolaterally; produces tears (lacrimal fluid)
- Nasolacrimal duct: Conducts tears from lacrimal punctum to nasal cavity

### Physiology of Vision

**Visual angle and visual acuity**:
- **Visual angle**: Angle formed between lines extending from both ends of an object through the optical center of the eye
- **Minimum visual angle**: Smallest visual angle the eye can distinguish
- **Visual acuity**: Ability to distinguish two points as separate; measured as reciprocal of minimum visual angle; normal vision ranges 1.0-2.0

**Visual field**:
- Range of space visible when eye remains stationary and fixates on one point
- Narrower medially (nasal side) due to nose; wider laterally (temporal side)
- Varies with color: White > Blue > Yellow
- Blind spot present in central visual field (corresponds to optic disc)

**Refractive errors**:
- **Emmetropia (normal vision)**: Parallel light rays focus on retina without accommodation; object 6 meters away appears sharp
- **Myopia (nearsightedness)**: Either eyeball too long or corneal/lens refraction too strong; image focuses anterior to retina; corrected with concave lens
- **Hyperopia (farsightedness)**: Eyeball too short; image focuses posterior to retina; corrected with convex lens; children often hyperopic but achieve normal refraction by age 6 due to eye growth
- **Astigmatism**: Different curvature in different meridians of cornea or lens; fails to form distinct focal point; corrected with cylindrical lens

**Visual cortex and pathway**:
- **Primary visual cortex** (Area 17): Located in occipital lobe; receives visual information; processes object form, contrast, and shape
- **Secondary visual cortex** (Areas 18-19): Surrounding Area 17; serves as association area; stores and recalls information; damage causes alexia (reading blindness) or psychic blindness
- **Visual pathway**: Retina → Optic nerve → Optic chiasm → Optic tract → Lateral geniculate nucleus → Optic radiation → Occipital visual cortex
- **Midbrain reflexes**: Some optic tract fibers synapse in superior colliculus (primary visual reflex center) controlling oculomotor and trochlear nerves; mediates pupillary light reflex and accommodation reflex

## 3. Vestibulocochlear Organ

The vestibulocochlear organ (auditory and vestibular apparatus) comprises external ear, middle ear, and internal ear. External and middle ear mainly function in hearing; internal ear functions in both hearing and equilibrium.

### External Ear

**Auricle (pinna)**:
- Irregular-shaped, elastic cartilage structure
- Collects and directs sound waves to external acoustic meatus

**External acoustic meatus**:
- S-shaped (curved) canal conducting sound to tympanum
- Approximately 2.5 cm length
- Amplifies air vibrations reaching tympanum
- Contains hair and cerumen (earwax) for protection
- Filters external debris and protects tympanum

**Tympanic membrane (eardrum)**:
- Boundary between external and middle ear
- Dimensions: 9 mm horizontal × 8 mm vertical × 0.1 mm thickness
- Pearlescent appearance
- Vibrates in response to sound waves

### Middle Ear

**Auditory ossicles** (3 tiny bones):
- **Malleus (hammer-shaped)**: Attached to tympanic membrane; transmits vibrations
- **Incus (anvil-shaped)**: Articulates between malleus and stapes
- **Stapes (stirrup-shaped)**: Articulates with oval window of internal ear
- Function: Transmit tympanic membrane vibrations to oval window

**Auditory tube (Eustachian tube)**:
- Connects middle ear to nasopharynx
- Allows air pressure equalization in tympanic cavity
- Permits air exchange between external environment and middle ear

### Internal Ear (Labyrinth)

**Bony labyrinth** (osseous labyrinth):
- Hard, compact bone structure (thickness 2-3 mm)
- Contains perilymph in space between bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth
- Comprises: vestibule, cochlea, and semicircular canals

- Closed, membranous structure within bony labyrinth
- Contains endolymph

**Vestibule (vestibular apparatus)**:
- Central chamber between cochlea and semicircular canals
- Contains saccule and utricle
- Two windows: oval window (stapes articulation) and round window (pressure relief)

**Semicircular canals** (3 bony canals):
- Anterior, posterior, and lateral semicircular canals
- Anterior and posterior canals oriented vertically; lateral canal oriented horizontally
- Each contains membranous duct with ampullary crests
- Function in detecting rotational movements

**Cochlea** (spiral-shaped structure):
- Snail-shell appearance
- Spirals 2.5-2.7 turns around modiolus
- Total length: 35 mm
- Contains:
  - **Cochlear duct (scala media)**: Contains endolymph; enclosed by vestibular membrane and basilar membrane
  - **Scala vestibuli**: Contains perilymph
  - **Scala tympani**: Contains perilymph
- Contains spiral organ (organ of Corti) → sensory epithelium with supporting cells and hair cells (sensory receptors)

**Vestibular apparatus**:
- **Macula** (sensory epithelium in utricle and saccule):
  - Detects static head position and linear acceleration
  - Contains supporting cells and hair cells
  - Covered by gelatinous material containing otoliths (calcium carbonate crystals)
  - Approximately 19,000 sensory fibers
  - Sensory fibers synapse in vestibular nuclei → brainstem → cerebellum → cerebral cortex
- **Semicircular canal ampullae** (sensory crests):
  - Detect rotational movements and angular acceleration
  - Hair cells bend with endolymph movement
  - Each ampulla innervated by anterior, posterior, or lateral ampullary nerve

### Equilibrium (Balance)

The vestibular apparatus maintains balance through:

**Static equilibrium** (head position sense):
- Maculae in utricle and saccule detect head position relative to gravity
- Otoliths provide weight stimulus; gravitational force causes gelatinous material to sag
- Hair cell stereocilia bend with material displacement
- Vestibular nerve signals go to brainstem vestibular nuclei → cerebellum → cerebral cortex

**Dynamic equilibrium** (rotational movement detection):
- Semicircular canal ampullae detect head rotation
- Endolymph displacement lags behind canal rotation (within 20 seconds)
- Hair cell bending transmits signals via vestibular nerve
- Constant-velocity movement not detected; only acceleration and deceleration detected
- Three canal system allows detection of movement in three planes

**Vestibular pathways**:
① Vestibular nerve fibers from maculae and ampullae synapse in vestibular nuclei (nucleus medialis, nucleus superior, nucleus inferior, nucleus lateralis) in medulla
② Vestibular nuclei project to:
- Cerebellum → coordinates posture
- Motor nuclei of oculomotor nerve (CN III), trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI) → conjugate eye movements and nystagmus
- Vestibulospinal tract → maintains postural muscle tone
- Thalamus → projects to sensory cortex (primary motor area) for conscious awareness

**Vestibulocephalic responses**:
- Maintain balance through head and neck muscle control
- Stabilize gaze during head movements
- Trigger righting reflexes
- Coordinate with visual and proprioceptive systems

### Auditory Pathway

Sound transmission process:
1. Sound waves vibrate tympanic membrane
2. Tympanic membrane vibrations transmitted through ossicular chain (malleus → incus → stapes)
3. Stapes base vibrates oval window
4. Oval window vibrations transmitted to perilymph in scala vestibuli
5. Perilymph vibrations cause basilar membrane displacement
6. Basilar membrane vibration displaces endolymph in cochlear duct
7. Hair cell stereocilia bend; hair cells generate neural signals
8. Cochlear nerve (CN VIII) transmits signals to brainstem

**Central auditory pathway**:
① Primary afferent fibers from hair cells synapse in cochlear nucleus (dorsal and ventral) in medulla
② Signals from dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei cross midline and reach superior olivary nucleus
③ Superior olivary nucleus compares timing and intensity information from both ears
④ Signals project to lateral lemniscus nuclei
⑤ From lateral lemniscus nuclei → inferior colliculus (midbrain) → medial geniculate nucleus (thalamus) → primary auditory cortex (Area 41-42, Brodmann; superior temporal gyrus)
⑥ Primary auditory cortex processes acoustic information
⑦ Secondary auditory cortex (adjacent to Area 41-42) receives signals for association, analysis, and recall

## 6. Visceral Sensation

### Visceral Pain

**Characteristics**:
- Poorly localized; origin not clearly defined
- Accompanied by autonomic symptoms (nausea, vomiting)
- Frequently referred to distant skin areas
- Caused by smooth muscle contraction, vascular insufficiency, and release of pain-producing substances

### Pain Nerve Pathway

**Pathway components**:
1. **Peripheral receptors**: Nociceptors (pain receptors), baroreceptors (pressure receptors), chemoreceptors in viscera
2. **First-order neurons**: Cell bodies in spinal dorsal horn ganglia; peripheral terminals contact nociceptors; central terminals in spinal dorsal horn
3. **Dorsal horn processing**: Interneurons modulate first-order neuron input before relay to second-order neurons
4. **Second-order neurons** (spinothalamic tract neurons): Cross to opposite side of spinal cord; ascend via lateral spinothalamic tract and spinoreticular tract
5. **Brainstem relay**: Signals reach medullary reticular formation
6. **Thalamic relay**: Signals reach thalamic nuclei (ventral posterior nucleus, posterior thalamic nuclei)
7. **Cortical processing**: Signals reach sensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system

### Pain Nerve Fibers

**A-delta fibers** (myelinated, fast pain fibers):
- Thin myelinated fibers
- Conduction velocity: 5-30 m/sec (typically ~30 m/sec)
- Transmit acute, sharp, piercing pain
- Originate from superficial body areas
- Pain stops when stimulus ceases
- Fast-conducting fibers cross spinal cord immediately and ascend via lateral spinothalamic tract

**C fibers** (unmyelinated, slow pain fibers):
- Fine unmyelinated fibers
- Conduction velocity: 0.5-2.0 m/sec (typically ~2 m/sec)
- Transmit chronic, aching, dull pain
- Poor pain localization; unclear pain origin
- Pain persists after stimulus ceases
- Associated with autonomic symptoms
- Conduct visceral pain
- Slow-conducting fibers synapse with one or more interneurons before crossing spinal cord

**Dual sensation**: When nociceptors are activated, both fiber types conduct signals, producing initial sharp/pricking pain followed by duller, throbbing pain that often intensifies and persists longer.

### Pain Modulation (Descending Pain Control)

**Inhibitory neurotransmitters** from brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla) descend via lateral funiculus (lateral lemniscus) to spinal dorsal horn:

- **Enkephalin** (neuropeptide):
  - Inhibits both fast and slow pain signals
  - Action similar to morphine and opiate drugs
  - Released in response to severe pain

- **Serotonin** (monoamine):
  - Stimulates other neurons to release enkephalin
  - Indirect pain inhibition mechanism

- **Endorphin** (neuropeptide):
  - Morphine-like analgesic peptide
  - Secreted from pituitary gland and hypothalamus
  - Released in response to severe pain stimuli
  - Modulates pain perception

**Mechanism**: Descending inhibitory pathways release neurotransmitters that suppress presynaptic nerve fibers in the dorsal horn, preventing pain signal transmission.

### Referred Pain

**Definition**: Pain arising from visceral organs perceived as coming from distant skin area (somatic referred pain)

**Mechanism**:
- Convergence of visceral and somatic pain fibers onto common spinal cord neurons
- Severe visceral input excites pain pathway neurons also receiving cutaneous input
- Cerebral cortex interprets location as cutaneous since skin represents larger cortical area
- Shared spinal nerve segmentation between visceral organ and skin area

**Examples**:
- Cardiac pain → referred to left arm and shoulder
- Pancreatic pain → referred to left upper quadrant
- Appendiceal pain → referred to periumbilical area
- Renal pain → referred to flank region

**Pathway**: Visceral sensory fibers → same spinal segment → converge with somatic pain fibers from skin → common ascending pathway → brain interprets as somatic pain
