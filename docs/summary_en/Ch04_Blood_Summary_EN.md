# Chapter 04. Blood

## 1. Blood

### Composition of Blood
- **Definition**: Blood has pH 7.35–7.45, specific gravity 1,050–1,060, slightly alkaline; color varies from bright red to dark red depending on oxygen content
- **Volume**: About 8–9% of body weight in adults, averaging 5–6 L
- **Viscosity**: About 2× higher than water due to cellular components
- **Components**:
  - Blood cells (45%): RBC, WBC, platelets
  - Plasma (55%): pale yellow fluid, ~90% water, remainder mostly plasma proteins
- **Hematocrit (HCT)**: Volume ratio of RBCs in blood, normal 42–45%
- RBCs and platelets lack nuclei; WBCs have nuclei
- **Plasma proteins**: Albumin, globulin, fibrinogen

### Functions of Blood
- **Respiratory gas transport**: O₂ from alveoli to tissues; CO₂ from tissues to lungs
- **Nutrient transport**: Absorbed nutrients from intestines to body tissues
- **Waste transport**: Urea, uric acid, lactic acid, creatinine → excretory organs (kidneys)
- **Body defense**: Immune substances, phagocytosis against bacteria
- **Electrolyte and water regulation**: Maintains blood pH at ~7.4
- **Hormone transport**: Hormones from endocrine glands to target organs
- **Blood coagulation**: Prevents blood loss from hemorrhage
- **Temperature regulation**: Maintains constant temperature of skeletal muscles and liver

## 2. Blood Cell Formation and Destruction

### Hematopoiesis
- **Origin**: All blood cells originate from hemocytoblasts (stem cells) in bone marrow
- **Fetal hematopoiesis stages**: Megaloblastic phase → Hepatic phase → Myeloid phase

### Postnatal Blood Cell Formation
- **Hematopoietic organs**: Myeloid tissue and lymphoid tissue
- **Until day 15 after birth**: Liver and spleen produce RBCs and WBCs
- **After age 3**: Red bone marrow gradually replaced by yellow bone marrow
  - Red bone marrow: Active hematopoiesis
  - Yellow bone marrow: Filled with fat, minimal hematopoietic function
- **Major hematopoietic sites**: Sternum, vertebrae, clavicle, ribs, ilium
- **Hematopoietic longevity**: Flat bones (vertebrae, sternum, skull, scapula, pelvis) maintain function longer than long bones (humerus, femur)
- **Required for RBC maturation**: Vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, iron (Fe), copper (Cu)

### Blood Cell Destruction
- RBCs destroyed by macrophage system in liver, spleen, and bone marrow
- **RBC lifespan**: ~120 days
- Hemoglobin (Hb) → heme + iron + globin → recycled for hemoglobin synthesis
- **Erythropoietin**: Produced by kidneys; stimulates RBC production in response to low oxygen

## 3. Formed Elements

### Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells)
- **Shape**: Biconcave disc, diameter 7.2 μm, edge thickness 2.2 μm, center 1 μm, surface area 120 μm², volume 87 μm²
- Mature cells lack nuclei and do not undergo cell division
- **Count**: Males 4.2–6.2 million/mm³, Females 4.5–5.1 million/mm³
- **Hemoglobin**: 1 globin + 4 heme molecules, MW 68,000
  - 1 g hemoglobin binds 1.34 mL O₂
  - Binds O₂ within 0.01 sec at high PO₂; releases O₂ at low PO₂
  - CO affinity ~200× greater than O₂
- **Oxyhemoglobin (HbO₂)**: Hemoglobin bound to O₂
- **Reduced hemoglobin (HbCO₂)**: Hemoglobin without O₂
- **Oxygen dissociation curve**: Hemoglobin-O₂ binding vs. PO₂

### Anemia
- Decreased RBC count or hemoglobin → tissue hypoxia → pallor, fatigue
- **Types**: Aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia

### Jaundice
- Abnormally elevated bilirubin → yellow discoloration of skin and mucous membranes
- **Hemolytic jaundice**: Mass RBC destruction → excessive bilirubin
- **Hepatic jaundice**: Liver disease prevents bilirubin excretion via bile ducts
- **Obstructive jaundice**: Gallstones or tumors block bilirubin passage to small intestine
- **Neonatal jaundice**: Appears 2–3 days after birth, resolves within ~10 days

### Leukocytes (White Blood Cells)
- 5,000–10,000/mm³, average 7,400; no sex difference
- **Granulocytes**:
  - **Neutrophils**: 12–14 μm, 60–70%, phagocytosis (acute inflammation), most important in innate immunity
  - **Eosinophils**: 12 μm, 1–4%, increase in allergic reactions and parasitic infections
  - **Basophils**: 9 μm, ~1%, contain heparin, prevent coagulation, promote healing at inflammation sites
- **Agranulocytes**:
  - **Lymphocytes**: 9–14 μm, 20–30%, produced in lymph nodes/thymus/spleen, produce antibodies
  - **Monocytes**: 15–20 μm, 2–6%, produced in bone marrow, develop into macrophages, phagocytosis (chronic inflammation)

### Platelets (Thrombocytes)
- Non-nucleated, granular, colorless, 2–4 μm diameter, irregular disc shape
- **Count**: 130,000–360,000/mm³, lifespan ~1 week
- Derived from megakaryocyte cytoplasm fragments
- **Secreted substances**: Serotonin, histamine, ATPase, Ca²⁺, K⁺, thromboplastin

### Blood Coagulation
- **Step 1**: Clotting factors released from platelets and damaged cells
- **Step 2**: Inactive proteins → prothrombin activator
- **Step 3**: Prothrombin → thrombin
- **Step 4**: Thrombin converts fibrinogen → fibrin
- **Step 5**: Fibrin mesh traps RBCs and platelets → clot formation
- **Hemophilia**: Congenital deficiency of clotting factor VIII
- **Vitamin K**: Required for prothrombin synthesis in liver
- **Warfarin**: Vitamin K antagonist → treats thrombosis

### Plasma
- 55% of blood volume, 90% water, 10% solutes
- **Plasma proteins** (7–8% of plasma):
  - **Albumin**: Smallest MW, 60%, synthesized in liver, regulates colloid osmotic pressure; deficiency → edema
  - **Globulins**: 36%; alpha and beta (liver), gamma (lymphoid tissue) → gamma globulin = immunoglobulin (Ig)
  - **Fibrinogen**: ~4%, key role in blood coagulation

### Blood Types
- **ABO system**: Agglutinogens (A, B) on RBC membrane + agglutinins (anti-A, anti-B) in serum → 4 types: A, B, AB, O
- **Transfusion**: Loss of >30–40% blood volume can be fatal; efficacy depends on timing, rate, volume, fluid type
- **Inheritance**: Blood type inherited from parents, unchanged throughout life

### Rh Factor
- Most Koreans are Rh-positive; only 0.4% Rh-negative
- Repeated Rh-positive transfusion to Rh-negative person → agglutinin formation → transfusion reaction
- Rh-negative mother + Rh-positive fetus → possible stillbirth
- Rh factor is dominant inheritance

## 4. Immunity

### Definition of Immunity
- Defense mechanism protecting host from infections
- Antigen: Substance that induces immune response
- Antibody: Binds specifically to antigen, neutralizes toxins and bacteria

### Cellular Immunity
- WBCs phagocytize and digest microorganisms
- **T-lymphocytes**: ~70–80% of lymphocytes
  - Killer T-cells (Tc), Helper T-cells (Th), Suppressor T-cells, Cytotoxic T-cells
- **Cytokines**: Polypeptides secreted by T-cells; specifically lymphokines
- Primary cause of transplant rejection (exception: identical twins)
- Immunosuppressants → temporary graft adaptation
- **Autoimmune reaction**: Immune system attacks own normal cells → autoimmune disease

### Humoral Immunity
- B-lymphocytes produce antibodies with Helper T-cell assistance
- B-cell clones → plasma cells or memory cells
- **Primary response**: Plasma cells produce antibodies
- **Secondary response**: Memory B-cells rapidly differentiate into plasma cells for massive antibody production

### Immunoglobulins (Ig)
- Gamma globulins produced by plasma cells in reticuloendothelial system
- **IgG**: MW 150,000–160,000, most abundant, only Ig to cross placenta, innate immunity
- **IgA**: MW 180,000, found in tears/nasal secretions/bronchial mucosa/intestinal mucosa/milk, bacterial defense
- **IgM**: MW 900,000, largest antibody, first to appear at inflammation sites, activates macrophages, includes anti-A and anti-B
- **IgD**: MW 150,000, antigen receptor, childhood milk allergy
- **IgE**: MW 200,000, parasitic infections/hay fever/allergic reactions

### Allergy
- Abnormal reaction to specific substance due to sensitivity
- **Allergens**: Mainly proteins (eggs, milk, fish, meat, grains)
- **Symptoms**: Hives, rash, indigestion, diarrhea, asthma, hay fever
- **Mechanism**: IgE → binds mast cells → histamine release → vasodilation, swelling, mucus secretion, smooth muscle contraction

### Active and Passive Immunization
- Immunity: Innate + Acquired (active, passive)
- **Active immunization**: Via vaccination; resistance develops in 5–14 days, lasts years
- **Passive immunization**: Receiving pre-formed antibodies; immediate effect, lasts days to weeks; mother-to-fetus/infant transfer possible
