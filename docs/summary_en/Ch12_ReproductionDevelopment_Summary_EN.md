# Chapter 12: Reproduction and Development

## Overview of Reproduction

Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms perpetuate their species before death. The reproductive organs (reproductive organs) are the structures involved in this process. In humans, males produce sperm (sperm) and females produce ova (ovum). When a single sperm and ovum fuse, they form a fertilized ovum (fertilized ovum), which develops into a fetus (fetus) within the female uterus. The fetus develops and is ultimately delivered as a newborn (new born) through delivery (delivery).

The primary functions of reproductive organs are:
1. Production of reproductive cells (sperm and ovum)
2. Secretion of sex hormones

## 1. Male Reproduction

### Structure of Male Reproductive System

The male reproductive system consists of the testes, seminal tract, accessory reproductive glands, and external genitalia.

#### (1) Testis (Testis)

The testis (testis) is a flattened oval organ located within the scrotum (scrotum), with a combined weight of approximately 8 grams. During fetal development, the testes initially lie below the kidneys but descend through the inguinal canal (inguinal canal) into the scrotum by birth.

**Structure:**
- Each testis is composed of approximately 100 lobules separated by connective tissue
- Each lobule contains numerous seminiferous tubules (seminiferous tubule)
- Between seminiferous tubules lie interstitial cells (interstitial cell, Leydig's cell), which secrete male hormones
- The seminiferous tubule consists of germinal epithelium (germinal epithelium) and sustentacular cells (sustentacular cell), with sperm formed through division of the germinal epithelium
- The seminiferous tubules converge into approximately 10 efferent ductules (efferent ductules) exiting the testis

#### (2) Seminal Tract (Seminal Tract)

The seminal tract (seminal tract) is the pathway through which sperm travels, consisting of the epididymis, ductus deferens, ejaculatory duct, and urethra.

**Components:**

- **Epididymis (epididymis):** Collects the approximately 10 efferent ductules from the testis and connects to the ductus deferens

- **Ductus Deferens (vas deferens):** Forms the spermatic cord (spermatic cord) with blood vessels and nerves distributed to the testis. This cord passes through the inguinal canal and enters the pelvis to connect with the ejaculatory duct

- **Ejaculatory Duct (ejaculatory duct):** A narrow tube connecting the ductus deferens and seminal vesicle that passes through the prostate gland and opens into the urethra. It remains closed except during ejaculation, compressed by the prostate gland

- **Urethra (urethra):** The tube through which urine and semen (semen) are expelled, passing through the corpus cavernosum of the penis and opening at the tip of the glans penis (glans penis)

#### (3) Accessory Reproductive Glands

**Seminal Vesicle (seminal vesicle):**
- Paired sac-shaped organs located immediately lateral to the ampulla of the ductus deferens behind the urinary bladder
- Functions: stores sperm and secretes alkaline secretion comprising part of semen
- This secretion promotes sperm motility

**Prostate Gland (prostate gland):**
- A gland approximately walnut-sized, surrounding the beginning of the ejaculatory duct and urethra at the base of the urinary bladder
- Prone to cancer and enlargement in old age, which impairs urination
- Secretes milky fluid with a night-blooming jasmine-like odor
- Comprises 30% of total semen volume
- Functions: activates sperm and maintains sperm motility

**Bulbourethral Gland (bulbourethral gland):**
- Corresponds to the female greater vestibular gland (Bartholin's gland)
- Tubular-alveolar gland with bright columnar epithelial cells
- Secretes a colorless mucus with high viscosity

#### (4) External Genitalia (External Genital Organ)

The male external genitalia consist of the scrotum and penis.

**Scrotum (scrotum):**
- A pouch containing the testes and epididymis

**Penis (penis):**
- Composed of the corpus cavernosum and surrounding skin
- The tip of the penis is called the glans penis (glans penis)
- The erectile tissue spaces of the penis are richly supplied with blood vessels
- During erection (erection), these spaces become engorged with blood, causing the penis to swell and lengthen

### Function of Male Reproductive System

#### (1) Spermatogenesis (Spermatogenesis)

**Origin of Sperm:**
During early embryonic development, reproductive cells migrate from the yolk sac (yolk sac) to the testes, where they become spermatogonia (spermatogonia) located outside the seminiferous tubules. Spermatogonia are diploid cells that produce mature haploid gametes through meiosis.

**Meiotic Process:**
Meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions:
- In the first meiotic division, DNA is replicated and homologous chromosomes separate into two daughter cells, each containing 23 chromosomes (haploid)
- Each of the 23 chromosomes consists of identical DNA sister chromatids
- During the second meiotic division, the sister chromatids separate, resulting in four haploid cells from one diploid spermatogonium

**Continuous Production:**
From 1,000 to 2,000 stem cells migrate from the yolk sac to the fetal testis. To produce numerous sperm throughout life, spermatogonia are replicated through mitosis, and one becomes a primary spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte) undergoing meiosis. This ensures spermatogonia numbers remain constant.

**Stages of Sperm Development:**

- **Primary Spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte):** A diploid cell that completes the first meiotic division to form two haploid secondary spermatocytes (secondary spermatocyte)

- **Secondary Spermatocyte (secondary spermatocyte):** A haploid cell that undergoes the second meiotic division to form a haploid spermatid (spermatid). Thus, one primary spermatocyte produces four spermatids

- **Spermatid to Mature Sperm:** The four spermatids resulting from meiosis remain interconnected—their cytoplasm does not completely separate. The process of these interconnected spermatids developing into fully mature sperm (spermatozoa) is called sperm metamorphosis (metamorphosis), which requires the action of sustentacular cells (Sertoli cells)

**Sex Determination:**
The sex of offspring is determined by sperm. Male somatic cells contain XY chromosomes, while female somatic cells contain XX chromosomes. Through meiosis, ova reduce their chromosome number but contain only X chromosomes. When an ovum is fertilized by sperm carrying an X chromosome, the fertilized ovum becomes XX (female); when fertilized by sperm carrying a Y chromosome, it becomes XY (male).

#### (2) Sperm (Sperm)

**Structure and Characteristics:**
The sperm (sperm) is the most highly differentiated cell in the human body. It measures 50-60 micrometers in length and consists of three regions: head, midpiece, and tail.

**Head (head):**
- Contains primarily the nucleus
- Filled with chromatin containing 23 chromosomes with genetic material
- The acrosome (acrosome) at the anterior end contains enzymes similar to lysosomes, enabling the sperm to penetrate the ovum during fertilization

**Midpiece (midpiece):**
- Contains filament-like material
- Mitochondria (mitochondria) are arranged in a spiral pattern, providing energy needed for sperm motility

**Tail (tail):**
- Moves side to side to propel the sperm forward
- Contains abundant ATP needed for sperm motility

**Lifespan:**
Unlike ova, sperm continue to be produced throughout the entire lifespan. The testicular spermatogonia number does not significantly decrease, so sperm production capacity remains undiminished. In the epididymis, sperm acquire motility and undergo other maturational changes. Sperm utilize fructose (fructose) secreted by the seminal vesicles as an energy source.

#### (3) Erection (Erection)

Erection can be stimulated by stimulation of the penis skin or by sexual desire. When the central nervous system centers in the sacral portion (sacral portion) of the spinal cord are excited, parasympathetic nerve fibers conduct neural excitation to blood vessels in the erectile tissue of the penis.

**Mechanism:**
- Arteries in the erectile tissue dilate
- Veins constrict
- A large volume of blood fills the erectile tissue under high pressure
- The penis increases in volume and length

This phenomenon is called erection (erection).

#### (4) Ejaculation (Ejaculation)

When sexual excitement reaches a certain threshold, the spinal cord center in the sacral portion of the spinal cord becomes excited. Sympathetic nerve fibers conduct neural excitation to the male reproductive organs, causing rhythmic contractions.

**Process:**
- Peristaltic waves (peristalsis) occur in the reproductive tract
- These waves begin at the testis and proceed through the epididymis, ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and penis
- Sperm are ultimately ejected from the testis into the vagina

**Ejaculate Composition:**
During ejaculation, secretions from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland mix with sperm, forming semen (semen).

**Volume and Sperm Count:**
- Approximately 3 milliliters of semen are expelled per ejaculation
- Each milliliter of semen contains approximately 100 million sperm
- Therefore, approximately 300 million sperm are ejected per ejaculation

#### (5) Male Sexual Response Cycle (Male Sexual Response Cycle)

The male sexual response during sexual intercourse progresses through four distinct stages:

**Excitement Phase (excitement phase):**
- Erection occurs and sexual sensation intensifies

**Plateau Phase (plateau phase):**
- Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and muscle tension increase

**Orgasmic Phase (orgasmic phase):**
- Ejaculation occurs and physical pleasure reaches its peak

**Resolution Phase (resolution phase):**
- Genital response and sexual desire return to a resting state

### Endocrine Regulation of Male Sexual Function

Around ages 10-14 after birth, the anterior pituitary gland begins secreting large amounts of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), promoting testicular development and activating testicular function. This period is called puberty (puberty).

**Hormones Affecting Male Reproduction:**

**Testosterone (testosterone):**
- Source: Interstitial cells of the testis
- Primary Functions:
  - Stimulates growth of reproductive organs and male sexual behavior
  - Stimulates sperm formation in the presence of FSH
  - Stimulates secondary sexual characteristics:
    - Enlargement of larynx and vocal cords
    - Increases body hair, especially facial, chest, axillary, and pubic regions; decreases scalp hair
    - Increases muscle and skeletal growth, creating broad shoulders and narrow waist
    - Thickens skin

**Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH):**
- Source: Hypothalamus
- Function: Stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete LH and FSH

**Luteinizing Hormone (LH):**
- Source: Anterior pituitary gland
- Function: Enhances development of interstitial cells (interstitial cells) in the testis

**Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH):**
- Source: Anterior pituitary gland
- Function: Prepares the germinal epithelium of seminiferous tubules to respond to testosterone

## 2. Female Reproduction

### Structure of Female Reproductive System

The female reproductive system consists of the ovary (internal reproductive organ), uterine tube, uterus, and vagina (internal reproductive organs), and the external genitalia (external reproductive organs).

#### (1) Ovary (Ovary)

The ovary (ovary) is a small, thin, oval gland (3 × 1.5 × 1.0 cm) located on both sides of the uterus within the pelvis, approximately the size of a thumbnail. Each ovary weighs approximately 7 grams and has an outer cortex and inner medulla.

**Structure:**
- The cortex forms the surface layer and contains ovarian follicles at various developmental stages
- The medulla is the inner portion

**Follicle Development:**
- During fetal development, each ovary contains over 200,000 primary follicles (primary follicle)
- The number of primary follicles decreases with age: by puberty, only approximately 400 remain
- Approximately 400 follicles mature during the female reproductive years; the remainder undergo apoptosis (apoptosis)
- Each follicle develops sequentially through stages to become a mature follicle (mature follicle or Graafian follicle)

**Ovulation (Ovulation):**
The mature follicle migrates toward and protrudes from the ovarian surface, eventually rupturing to release the mature ovum (ovum) into the uterine tube (or peritoneal cavity). This phenomenon is called ovulation (ovulation) and occurs alternately between the two ovaries.

**Mature Ovum:**
- Large cell with a diameter of approximately 0.2 millimeters

**Corpus Luteum Formation:**
When a follicle ruptures for ovulation, it hemorrhages, temporarily becoming the corpus rubrum (corpus rubrum). It then forms the corpus luteum (corpus luteum), which contains lutein cells (lutein) that secrete the hormone progesterone (progesterone).

**Corpus Luteum Lifespan:**
- Lifespan of 14±2 days
- Begins regression before the next menstrual period, forming the corpus albicans (corpus albicans)
- If the ovum is fertilized and implants, it does not regress; instead, it becomes the pregnancy corpus luteum, which maintains pregnancy

**Cells Surrounding the Oocyte:**
The ring of granulosa cells (granulosa cell) surrounding the oocyte is called the corona radiata (corona radiata). Between the oocyte and corona radiata lies the zona pellucida (zona pellucida), a gel layer of proteins and polysaccharides that serves as a barrier to sperm penetration.

#### (2) Uterine Tube (Uterine Tube)

The uterine tube (fallopian tube, uterine tube) is a narrow tube approximately 10 centimeters long extending between the ovary and the fundus of the uterus. The end toward the ovary is funnel-shaped, opening into the peritoneal cavity. At the margin of this funnel portion, numerous soft, finger-like structures called fimbriae (fimbriae of uterine tube) project in a fan-like arrangement.

**Function in Ovum Transport:**
The end of the uterine tube lies very close to the ovary. The ciliated epithelial cells lining the inside of the uterine tube constantly move fluid toward the uterus. When a follicle ruptures and the ovum enters the peritoneal cavity, it is drawn into the uterine tube by the fluid flow and transported toward the uterus. The mucous membrane inside the uterine tube is highly convoluted and complex, requiring 3-7 days for the ovum to reach the uterus from ovulation.

**Sperm Survival and Fertilization:**
- An ovulated ovum dies within 8-24 hours if not fertilized by sperm
- Fertilization occurs in the ampulla (ampulla) of the uterine tube
- Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for 24-72 hours

#### (3) Uterus (Uterus)

The uterus (uterus) is a flattened, pear-shaped organ located between the urinary bladder and rectum (rectum).

**External Regions:**
- **Fundus (fundus):** The top portion
- **Body (corpus):** The middle portion
- **Cervix (cervix):** The lower portion, with part (vaginal portion) protruding into the vagina

**Internal Structure:**
The uterine cavity (uterine cavity) is lined with three layers of uterine wall:
- **Endometrium (tunica intima):** The mucous lining consisting of glandular epithelium, rich in blood vessels and glands, undergoes periodic changes in response to ovarian hormones
- **Myometrium:** A thick layer of smooth muscle (smooth muscle)
- **Serosa (tunica externa):** The outermost peritoneal layer

**Uterine Cavity Shape:**
Isosceles triangle-shaped. The upper end receives the uterine tubes; the lower end opens into the vagina through the cervix at the internal os (internal os) and external os (external os).

#### (4) Vagina (Vagina)

The vagina (vagina) is a hollow tubular organ approximately 7 centimeters long connecting to the uterus, located between the urethra and rectum (rectum).

**Structure:**
- The vaginal entrance is marked by the hymen (hymen), a connective tissue structure
- The mucous membrane is covered with stratified squamous epithelium
- Multiple horizontal folds are present

**Functions:**
- Female copulatory organ
- Birth canal (birth canal) during parturition

#### (5) External Genitalia (Vulva)

The external genitalia (external genital organ, vulva, pudendum) are the collective term for female external genitalia, consisting of:
- Labia majora (labia majora)
- Labia minora (labia minora)
- Clitoris (clitoris)
- Greater vestibular gland (greater vestibular gland or Bartholin's gland)
- Vestibule (vestibulum)
- Hymen (hymen)

#### (6) Mammary Gland (Mammary Gland)

The mammary gland (mammary gland) is an accessory organ of the female reproductive system.

**Structure:**
- The breast (mamma) is a compound tubulo-alveolar gland with a structure similar to apocrine sweat glands (apocrine sweat gland)
- In males, it regresses with only ducts remaining
- The peripheral portion of the breast consists of adipose tissue
- The internal portion contains 15-20 mammary glands

**Gland Alveoli Structure:**
- Each gland lobe contains numerous acini (alveoli) and one lactiferous duct (lactiferous duct) embedded in connective tissue
- Each acinus is surrounded by myoepithelial cells (myoepithelial cell)
- Lactiferous ducts enlarge beneath the nipple to form the lactiferous sinus (lactiferous sinus), opening at the nipple (nipple)

**Anatomical Features:**
- The area surrounding the nipple with increased pigmentation is called the areola (areola)
- The areola contains areolar glands (areolar gland) with intermediate structure between sweat glands and mammary glands
- The margins of the areola contain apocrine glands (apocrine gland) or eccrine sweat glands
- The skin of the nipple and areola is richly supplied with nerve endings

**Developmental Changes:**
- In females: Develops rapidly from just before puberty in response to FSH and LH, reaching maximum development by age 20. Becomes active during pregnancy and lactation; begins regression after age 40 and becomes atrophied after menopause
- In males: Degenerates, with only ducts remaining

---

### Oogenesis (Oogenesis)

During early fetal development, reproductive cells migrate to the ovary and proliferate. By the fifth month of gestation, the ovary contains approximately 6-7 million oogonia (oogonia). Most oogonia die before birth through apoptosis (apoptosis).

**Early Stages:**
Oogonia begin meiosis in late gestation, becoming primary oocytes (primary oocyte). However, the cells remain arrested in the prophase of the first meiotic division, so the primary oocyte remains diploid.

**Postnatal Development:**
The number of primary oocytes decreases throughout life:
- Newborns are born with approximately 2 million primary oocytes in the ovaries
- Each oocyte is surrounded by follicle cells, forming a primary follicle (primary follicle)
- By the time females reach puberty, the number decreases to approximately 400,000
- During the female reproductive years, only approximately 400 follicles undergo ovulation; the remainder die through apoptosis

**Follicle Development and Oocyte Maturation:**

In response to FSH stimulation, some oocytes and follicles increase in size, with follicle cells dividing to form multiple layers of granulosa cells (granulosa cell) surrounding the oocyte. Some primary follicles develop further, forming multiple small fluid-filled spaces, resulting in secondary follicles (secondary follicle). As these secondary follicles grow, the small spaces coalesce, forming the antral space, and these are called mature follicles or Graafian follicles (Graafian follicle).

**Meiotic Completion:**
Through meiosis, the primary oocyte produces:
- A secondary oocyte (secondary oocyte)
- A first polar body (first polar body)

The secondary oocyte retains all the cytoplasm. The secondary oocyte continues with the second meiotic division, producing:
- One second polar body
- One mature ovum (ovum)

The first polar body also undergoes meiosis, producing two secondary polar bodies. Thus, three polar bodies and one mature ovum result from oogenesis, with all polar bodies degenerating.

### Female Sexual Behavior

#### (1) Erection and Lubrication (Lubrication)

Around the vaginal opening, erectile tissue is present. When the clitoris and external genitalia are stimulated by the clitoris and central sexual excitement, the nerve center in the sacral spinal cord (sacral portion) is excited.

**Mechanism:**
Via parasympathetic nerve fibers, the neural excitation reaches the erectile tissue, causing:
- Blood engorgement and swelling of the external genitalia
- Narrowing of the vaginal opening

**Lubrication:**
Parasympathetic nerve excitation stimulates the greater vestibular gland (greater vestibular gland, Bartholin's gland) on both sides of the vaginal opening to secrete mucus. This mucus provides lubrication during sexual intercourse.

#### (2) Orgasm (Orgasm)

Female sexual pleasure primarily results from friction of the clitoris (clitoris). The clitoris is the female equivalent of the male penis, containing abundant sensory nerves and erectile tissue.

**Orgasmic Response:**
When female sexual pleasure reaches a certain level, rhythmic muscle contractions occur in the uterus, uterine tubes, and surrounding tissues. This phenomenon is called orgasm (orgasm). This results in peristaltic waves in the female reproductive tract, which help draw ejaculated semen into the uterus.

---

### Endocrine Regulation of Female Sexual Function

The ovary and uterus undergo regular periodic changes in preparation for ovulation and pregnancy. This is called the sexual cycle (sexual cycle), which is regulated by the cooperative action of several hormones.

#### (1) Periodic Changes in Endometrium (Endometrial Cycle)

Following the ovary's periodic changes, the uterus also undergoes periodic changes. These uterine changes are caused by hormones secreted by the ovary and consist of four phases:

**Menstrual Phase (menstrual phase):**
When fertilization of the ovum does not occur, the corpus luteum of the ovary regresses, becoming the corpus albicans, and progesterone and estrogen secretion ceases. The sudden decrease in these hormones causes:
- The uterine mucosa sloughs off
- Blood and tissue are expelled from the body through the vagina
- This phenomenon is called menstruation (menstruation)
- Lasts approximately 3-5 days

**Proliferative Phase (proliferative phase):**
- Influenced by estrogen
- The uterine mucosa proliferates and thickens

**Secretory Phase (secretory phase):**
- Occurs after ovulation, influenced by progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum
- The uterine mucosa becomes congested and secretory products increase
- This represents preparation for implantation of a fertilized ovum
- The uterine gland secretions contain abundant nutrients
- Fats and glycogen increase in the endometrium
- Blood flow increases
- This represents preparation for implantation of a fertilized ovum

**Premenstrual Phase (premenstrual phase):**
- Brief 2-3 day period at the end of the menstrual cycle
- Local ischemia develops in the endometrium, with hemorrhage resulting from capillary rupture
- However, if the ovulated ovum is fertilized and implants, the endometrium maintains its proliferative state from the secretory phase, and pregnancy becomes established

**Period of Fertility (Fertility Period):**
After ovulation, an ovum can be fertilized only within 8-24 hours. Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for 24-72 hours. Therefore, sexual intercourse must occur from several hours before ovulation to several hours after ovulation.

#### (2) Female Reproductive Organ Development and Ovarian Hormones

Two hormones, estrogen (estrogen) and progesterone (progesterone), are produced by the ovary. These not only produce the sexual cycle but also greatly contribute to the development of female reproductive organs. Both possess steroid nuclei and are produced using lipids as raw material.

**Estrogen (estrogen):**
- **Source:** Follicles within the ovary
- **Primary Functions:**
  - Stimulates growth of reproductive organs and uterine endometrial reformation
  - Stimulates female secondary sexual characteristics:
    - Promotes fat deposition in the breast, pelvis, and hip regions
    - Increases muscle and skeletal growth, creating a narrow waist and wide pelvis
    - Promotes development of breast glands and ducts
  - Stimulates proliferation of various tissue cells
  - Promotes proliferation of smooth muscle in the uterus, enlarging it to 2-3 times the size of the prepubertal uterus
  - After puberty, promotes development of the vagina and labia
  - Stimulates public hair growth and increases body hair in the hip, pelvic, and breast regions; increases female body shape and body hair
  - Promotes bone growth: stimulates bone growth shortly after puberty, but this action lasts 4-5 years. Consequently, girls grow taller than boys shortly after puberty, but because this action period is relatively short, sustained skeletal growth in boys results in ultimately greater height in males

**Progesterone (progesterone):**
- **Source:** Corpus luteum in the ovary and placenta during pregnancy
- **Primary Functions:**
  - Enhances reformation of the uterine endometrium
  - Guides uterine glands from the proliferative phase to the secretory phase, preparing the endometrium to receive and develop the fertilized ovum and maintain pregnancy
  - Promotes endometrial proliferation suitable for fetal development
  - Maintains the uterus during pregnancy
  - Prepares breast tissue for milk secretion
  - Inhibits uterine contractions, preventing expulsion of the implanted fertilized ovum or fetus (preventing abortion/miscarriage)

---

### Lactation (Lactation)

#### (1) Milk Ejection Reflex (Milk Ejection Reflex)

When an infant sucks the nipple (nipple), milk does not flow for the first approximately 45 seconds. Then it suddenly begins, and simultaneously milk emerges from the opposite nipple even without sucking. This is a type of reflex mechanism involving hormone secretion.

**Mechanism:**
- Sucking stimulation activates sensory pathways in the nipple
- This sensory excitation is transmitted to the hypothalamus
- The hypothalamus stimulates the posterior pituitary gland to release oxytocin (oxytocin)
- Oxytocin, transported via the bloodstream, reaches the alveolar walls (alveoli) of the breast
- Oxytocin causes contraction of myoepithelial cells (myoepithelial cells) in the alveolar walls
- Milk (breast milk) stored in the glandular cells is expelled

**Psychological Factors:**
The milk ejection mechanism is greatly influenced by psychological factors. If the mother is in a state of great fear or other psychological instability, milk may not be ejected. If this state persists, prolactin (prolactin) secretion from the pituitary gland ceases, stopping milk production.

#### (2) Milk Composition

Milk (breast milk) contains all components necessary for an infant's early development:

**Proteins:**
- Casein (casein)
- Lactalbumin (lactalbumin)

**Carbohydrates:**
- Lactose (lactose), a disaccharide formed by the combination of one glucose and one galactose

**Lipids:**
- Rich in neutral fats, cholesterol, and phospholipids

**Minerals and Vitamins:**
- Small amounts of vitamins
- Abundant calcium phosphate
- Very little iron

**Nutritional Considerations:**
- During fetal development, the fetus receives iron from the mother; the newborn liver stores large quantities
- For approximately 2 months after birth, iron reserves suffice for red blood cell production
- Subsequently, if iron is not appropriately provided, progressive anemia may develop
- Nursing mothers require increased nutrient intake similar to pregnancy levels
- Protein, lipids, and calcium are especially important as these nutrients are transferred in large quantities in breast milk

## 3. Human Development

### Development (Embryonic Development)

Individual development begins when a mature ovum and sperm fuse to form a single cell called the fertilized ovum (fertilized ovum). This process is called fertilization (fertilization).

**Early Development Stages:**

The fertilized ovum undergoes repeated divisions through the morula stage (morula stage), where cells accumulate. Further divisions result in the blastocyst (blastula) stage, with an internal cavity (blastocyst cavity).

Fertilization occurs in the ampulla of the uterine tube. As the embryo divides, it is transported to the uterus, where it implants into the uterine mucosa. This process is called implantation (implantation).

**Gastrulation and Germ Layer Formation:**

By the second week of gestation, the blastocyst is completely embedded in the uterine mucosa. Cells from the outer layer continue to divide, forming the placenta. Part of the blastocyst folds inward, creating a double-layered structure (gastrula), consisting of:
- **Ectoderm (ectoderm):** Outer layer
- **Endoderm (endoderm):** Inner layer

Following this stage, differentiation occurs, and the mesoderm (mesoderm) develops between the ectoderm and endoderm. Each germ layer then undergoes further proliferation and differentiation, forming various tissues and organs.

**Tissue and Organ Origins:**

The principal tissues and organs arising from each germ layer are:

**Endoderm (endoderm):**
- Digestive tract epithelium and accessory glands
- Respiratory tract mucous epithelium

**Mesoderm (mesoderm):**
- Skeletal system
- Muscles
- Connective tissue
- Blood
- Circulatory system
- Urogenital system

**Ectoderm (ectoderm):**
- Epidermis and its accessory glands
- Nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
- Sensory organs (primary components)

Smooth muscle (smooth muscle) and connective tissue derived from the mesoderm are distributed throughout the body, combining with ectodermal or endodermal tissues to participate in the formation of all organs.

**Fetal Environment:**

The fetus (fetus) is surrounded by the amnion (amnion) and floats in amniotic fluid (amniotic fluid) within the amniotic cavity (amniotic cavity). The fetus is connected to the mother by the umbilical cord (umbilical cord) and placenta (placenta), through which it receives nutrition and oxygen while exchanging waste products.

---

### Monthly Fetal Development

Parturition typically occurs around day 280 from the first day of the last menstrual period. When calculating fetal age, pregnancy is divided into 10 months, with each month comprising 4 weeks or 28 days, calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period. However, fertilization occurs approximately 2 weeks after the first day of menstruation, so 2 weeks must be subtracted when calculating from the date of fertilization.

**First Week:**
- The embryo becomes an early blastocyst
- The blastocyst reaches the uterine cavity and begins implantation

**Second Week:**
- The amniotic cavity and yolk sac form
- Implantation is completed

**Third Week:**
- The mesoderm develops

**Fourth Week:**
- Each germ layer differentiates significantly, forming the basic structures of various organs
- The ectoderm covers nearly the entire surface of the embryo, and the fetus gradually acquires external form
- Embryonic length: 3-4 millimeters

**Two Months (Eighth Week After Fertilization):**
- The embryo takes on the characteristics of a human fetus
- Body length: 13-15 millimeters
- Up to this point, the embryo is called an embryo (embryo); after 8 weeks, it is called a fetus (fetus)

**Three Months (Month-end):**
- External genitalia form, making sex differentiation apparent
- Body length: 50-55 millimeters

**Four Months (Month-end):**
- Nose and mouth open
- Body length: approximately 10 centimeters

**Five Months:**
- Fine hair (lanugo) appears over the entire body
- The mother perceives fetal movements (quickening)

**Six Months:**
- Subcutaneous fat forms

**Seven Months:**
- Hair appears on the scalp
- Eyelid fissures (eye opening) separate

**Eight Months:**
- Subcutaneous fat increases, reducing surface wrinkles
- The body surface is covered with vernix caseosa, formed from sebaceous gland secretions and desquamated epidermis
- From this point, special life support is no longer necessary for survival outside the uterus

**Ninth Month:**
- Scalp hair becomes well defined
- Lanugo begins to regress

**Tenth Month (Month-end):**
- Body length (from crown to sole): approximately 50 centimeters
- Body weight: approximately 3 kilograms

The mature placenta has a diameter of approximately 20 centimeters, thickness of 2.5 centimeters, and weighs 450 grams.

**Fetal Surface (Chorionic Surface):**
- Relatively flat
- Large blood vessels converge toward the umbilical cord beneath the amnion

**Maternal Surface:**
- Red and rough
- At parturition, after the fetus is born, the placenta separates from the uterus (afterbirth)

**Umbilical Cord (Umbilical Cord):**
The fetus and placenta are connected by the umbilical cord (umbilical cord), which consists of:
- **Umbilical Arteries (umbilical artery):** Two arteries transporting fetal blood from the fetus to the placenta
- **Umbilical Vein (umbilical vein):** One vein carrying blood from the placenta to the fetus
- **Remnants of the yolk sac:** Elongated allantois
- **Allantoic Duct (allantoic duct):** Derived from the endoderm
- **Outer mesoderm:** Binds the structures of the umbilical cord, with the outer surface covered by amniotic epithelium traversing the expanded amniotic cavity

**Functional Significance:**
The placenta is both a site of material exchange between mother and fetus and an important endocrine gland.

#### (2) Functions of the Placenta

1. **Nutritional Exchange:** Transfers carbohydrates, proteins, fats, water, minerals, vitamins, hormones, and antibodies from maternal blood into fetal blood

2. **Gas Exchange:** Diffuses oxygen (O₂) from maternal blood to the fetus and diffuses carbon dioxide (CO₂) from fetal blood into maternal blood

3. **Waste Removal:** Transports water-soluble waste products generated from fetal metabolism from fetal blood into maternal blood

4. **Barrier Function:** Prevents harmful substances such as bacteria from crossing, serving as a protective barrier

5. **Hormone Production:** Produces hormones including estrogen (estrogen), progesterone (progesterone), and gonadotropins

**Placental Hormones:**

- **Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG):** A pituitary-like hormone with LH-like action; maintains the maternal corpus luteum during the first 5.5 weeks of pregnancy; suppresses embryonic immune rejection; has TSH-like activity

- **Human Chorionic Somatomammotropin (HCS):** Similar to prolactin and growth hormone; in the mother, HCS promotes fat breakdown and glucose conservation for fetal use

- **Progesterone:** Maintains the endometrium during pregnancy; suppresses gonadotropin secretion; promotes glandular and ductal development in the breast

- **Estrogen:** Maintains the endometrium during pregnancy; suppresses gonadotropin secretion; promotes breast gland development; suppresses prolactin secretion; promotes uterine responsiveness to oxytocin

### Labor and Delivery

Labor refers to all processes causing delivery, while delivery (delivery) or birth (birth) refers to the process of the infant being born.

**False Labor (Braxton-Hicks Contractions):**
False labor occurs 3-4 weeks before parturition and is characterized by irregular uterine contractions. Regular uterine contractions, mucus discharge from the cervix, and rupture of the amniotic membrane indicate approaching parturition.

**Onset of True Labor:**
Although the exact cause remains unknown, true labor typically begins when the fetus has matured enough to survive independently without maternal support. Labor duration varies: in primiparous women (first pregnancy), labor typically lasts approximately 14 hours; in multiparous women (subsequent pregnancies), labor progressively shortens to 7-8 hours.

**Preparations Before Labor:**
10-14 days before parturition, the fetal head settles into the pelvis.

#### (1) First Stage of Labor (Dilation Stage)

The first stage of labor is called the dilation stage (dilation stage), during which true contractions appear and the cervix dilates progressively to accommodate the fetal head (approximately 10 centimeters in diameter).

**Process:**
- Contractions begin weakly at the uterine fundus and progress downward toward the vagina
- Contractions progressively become stronger and more frequent
- With each contraction, the fetal head presses against the cervix
- The cervix softens and thins, gradually dilating
- Eventually, the amniotic fluid ruptures and flows out (breaking the water)
- This stage is the longest stage of labor, typically lasting 6-12 hours

#### (2) Second Stage of Labor (Expulsion Stage)

The second stage of labor is called the expulsion stage (expulsion stage), the period from full cervical dilation to fetal expulsion. During this stage:
- The infant passes through the cervix and vagina and exits the mother's body
- During natural delivery (without regional anesthesia), the abdominal muscles exert progressively greater force (straining/pushing)
- Duration: up to 2 hours but typically 50 minutes in primiparous women and 20 minutes in multiparous women

---

#### (3) Third Stage of Labor (Placental Stage)

The third stage of labor is called the placental stage (placental stage), the period when the placenta is expelled immediately following fetal delivery.

**Process:**
- The placenta is typically expelled within 15 minutes of fetal delivery
- Following delivery, uterine contractions continue vigorously, compressing blood vessels and restricting blood flow
- This causes the placenta to separate from the uterine wall
- The placenta and associated membranes are collectively called the afterbirth (afterbirth)
- Gentle traction on the umbilical cord easily removes the afterbirth
- All placental tissue and membranes must be removed to prevent continued postpartum hemorrhage (postpartum bleeding)

---

#### (4) Fourth Stage of Labor (Recovery Stage)

The fourth stage of labor is called the recovery stage (recovery stage), the 1-4 hour period following placental expulsion. This is a potentially critical period requiring careful observation for complications such as:
- Hemorrhage from uterine atony
- Urinary retention (urinary retention)
- Hypotension

## Summary

Chapter 12 presents comprehensive coverage of human reproduction and development. The male reproductive system produces sperm through spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules and delivers semen through the seminal tract during ejaculation, with testosterone regulating these processes. The female reproductive system produces ova through oogenesis, with follicle development and ovulation occurring under hormonal control; the endometrium undergoes cyclical changes in preparation for potential pregnancy. Human development begins with fertilization, progresses through early embryonic stages forming the three germ layers, and continues through fetal development with characteristic changes occurring monthly. The placenta serves as the critical interface for maternal-fetal exchange, while labor and delivery occur in four distinct stages to culminate in birth.
