# Chapter 10. Endocrine System

## 1. Pituitary Gland

### Overview of the Endocrine System
- **Definition**: The endocrine system produces hormones that are released directly into the circulatory system to regulate metabolism and bodily processes
- **Endocrine glands**: Thyroid, pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, thymus, parathyroid, testis (female: ovary)
- **Hormone**: Derived from the Greek word meaning "substance that awakens from sleep"
- **Biological characteristics of hormones**:
  - Highly effective even in very small amounts
  - No species specificity; effects are the same across animal species
  - Often do not produce antibodies when injected into different species
  - Relatively simple structure and small molecular weight even as proteins
  - Hormones other than sex hormones and thyroid hormones are broken down by digestive enzymes when administered orally
  - Both excess and deficient secretion is harmful; daily secretion depends on body weight, age, sex, and physical activity

### Pituitary Structure (Pituitary body, Hypophysis)
- **Location**: Within the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone at the base of the cranial cavity
- **Size**: Pea-sized; male 0.5–0.6g, female 0.6–0.7g (female slightly heavier)
- **Connection**: Connected to the floor of the third ventricle via the infundibulum
- **Composition**:
  - Adenohypophysis → anterior lobe + pars intermedia
  - Neurohypophysis → posterior lobe + infundibulum

### Anterior Lobe Hormones
- **TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)**: Promotes thyroid development, stimulates thyroxine (T₄) secretion, negative feedback mechanism
- **ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)**: 33-amino acid polypeptide, regulates adrenal cortex endocrine activity, promotes glucocorticoid secretion, negative feedback mechanism
- **FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)**: Female — promotes ovarian cell activity/maturation, stimulates estrogen secretion / Male — acts on Sertoli's cells (supporting cells) to promote spermatogenesis
- **LH (Luteinizing Hormone)**: Female — promotes ovulation, corpus luteum formation, progesterone secretion / Male — acts on Leydig's cells (interstitial cells) to promote testosterone secretion → also called ICSH (Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone)
- **GH (Growth Hormone)**: Promotes bone and soft tissue growth, stimulates gluconeogenesis and glycogen breakdown, raises blood fat levels. Also called somatotropin (STH). Excess → gigantism; excess after growth → acromegaly; deficiency during growth → dwarfism
- **Prolactin (PRL)**: Targets only the mammary gland, molecular weight ~25,000, stimulates milk secretion. Also called luteotropic hormone (LTH)

### Posterior Lobe Hormones
- **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone, Vasopressin)**: Promotes water reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, inhibits diuresis. Deficiency → diabetes insipidus (excessive urination, severe thirst)
- **Oxytocin (OT)**: Contracts uterine muscles → promotes labor; contracts myoepithelial cells on alveolar walls of mammary glands → milk ejection

## 2. Thyroid Gland

### Thyroid Structure
- **Weight**: ~30g, the largest endocrine gland in humans
- **Location**: Anterior neck, superior to the trachea
- **Shape**: Butterfly-like appearance
- **Composition**: Two lateral lobes (left and right) + isthmus
- **Histological features**: Follicular structure, high iodine content
- **Hormones**: Primarily thyroxine (T₄), some triiodothyronine (T₃). Same function but T₃ is more potent. Parafollicular cells also secrete thyrocalcitonin

### Thyroid Hormone Synthesis and Secretion
- Dietary iodine → absorbed in GI tract → transported via blood → thyroid follicular cells actively take up iodine
- Synthesized thyroid hormone stored in colloid bound to protein
- Released by separating from protein into the bloodstream
- Regulated by TSH from the anterior pituitary

### Physiological Actions of Thyroid Hormones
- Promotion of metabolism
- Growth and development (especially bones, teeth, skeletal muscles)
- Enhancement of sympathetic nervous activity → increased heart rate, vasodilation, increased blood flow, sweating
- Promotion of intellectual development and mental function
- Stimulation of milk secretion from mammary glands
- Increased blood sugar through sugar absorption and gluconeogenesis promotion
- Promotion of cholesterol excretion via bile

### Hypothyroidism
- **Children**: Cretinism — dwarfism, impaired CNS development, delayed cognitive development
- **Adults**: Myxedema — mental sluggishness, slow heartbeat, low skin temperature, dry skin, hair loss, subcutaneous mucoid substance accumulation → edema

### Hyperthyroidism
- Basedow's disease = Graves' disease
- **Three symptoms**: Exophthalmos, tachycardia, goiter
- Elevated basal metabolism, increased appetite, weight loss
- **Treatment**: Partial thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine (I¹³¹)

### Thyrocalcitonin
- Also called calcitonin (CT)
- Lowers blood calcium concentration → hypocalcemic hormone
- Antagonistic action against parathormone (hypercalcemic hormone)
- Inhibits osteoclast activity → suppresses Ca²⁺ release from bone
- Increases osteocyte activity → Ca²⁺ deposition → lowered blood Ca²⁺

## 3. Parathyroid Gland

### Parathyroid Structure
- **Location**: Posterior surface of thyroid, one pair above and one pair below, 4 total
- **Size**: Rice grain–sized
- **Hormone**: Parathormone (PTH)

### Parathormone Function
- Hypercalcemic hormone — raises blood Ca²⁺ concentration
- Involved in bone and tooth development
- PTH decrease → blood calcium falls to ~1/2 of normal → muscle spasm → tetany (more common in children and pregnant women)
- Ca²⁺ ion regulation: decreased Ca²⁺ → stimulates parathyroid → PTH secretion → releases Ca²⁺ from bone into body fluid
- **Blood Ca²⁺ regulation**: Coordinated action of parathormone, calcitonin, and calcitriol

## 4. Pancreas

### Pancreas Structure
- **Location**: Behind the stomach, anterior to L1–L2 vertebrae, horizontal across posterior abdominal wall
- **Parts**: Head, body, tail
- **Function**: Both exocrine (digestive gland) and endocrine (hormones)
- **Pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans)**: ~1 million, most abundant in the tail, 1–2% of total pancreatic weight
  - α cells (10–30%): Stained red by aniline, secrete glucagon
  - β cells (60–90%): Stained blue-violet by aniline, secrete insulin
  - δ cells (1–8%): No granules, secrete somatostatin

### Insulin
- Protein hormone secreted by β cells
- **Physiological actions**:
  - Lowers blood glucose: facilitates glucose entry into tissue cells
  - Hyperpolarization: increases resting membrane potential, raises intracellular K⁺ and lowers extracellular K⁺
  - Promotes conversion of sugar to fat
  - Promotes protein synthesis

### Diabetes Mellitus
- Caused by hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency
- **Type I (IDDM)**: Insulin-dependent, β cell destruction, mainly in children, requires insulin treatment
- **Type II (NIDDM)**: Non-insulin-dependent, decreased cellular responsiveness to insulin, reduced tissue sensitivity
- **Symptoms**: Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, decreased libido

### Glucagon
- Secreted by α cells, 29-amino acid polypeptide
- Raises blood glucose, antagonistic to insulin
- Main target organ: liver
- Neither excess nor deficiency causes significant disorders

- **Medulla**: Dark brown, relatively soft, chromaffin cells

### Adrenal Medulla Hormones
- **Epinephrine (adrenaline)**: Predominantly secreted in humans and dogs
- **Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)**: Precursor of epinephrine, neurotransmitter at postganglionic fiber terminals. Predominantly secreted in cats
- **Catecholamines**: Epinephrine + norepinephrine + dopamine. Biosynthesized from phenylalanine. Methylation of norepinephrine → epinephrine
- **Epinephrine effects**: Strong cardiac stimulation, skeletal muscle vasodilation, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis → blood glucose increase
- **Norepinephrine effects**: Weaker cardiac stimulation, vasoconstriction → significant blood pressure increase, arteriole constriction in skeletal muscle, skin, and viscera

### Adrenal Cortex Hormones
- Hyperfunction → Cushing syndrome; hypofunction → Addison's disease
- **Zona glomerulosa**: Outermost layer, secretes mineralocorticoids → aldosterone — promotes Na⁺ reabsorption, regulates body fluid
- **Zona fasciculata**: Middle layer, thickest (>⅔ of cortex), secretes glucocorticoids → cortisol, cortisone
- **Zona reticularis**: Innermost layer, secretes androgens + small amount of glucocorticoids

### Major Actions of Glucocorticoids
- Conversion of fat and protein to carbohydrates → gluconeogenesis
- Anti-inflammatory action → treatment of rheumatic diseases
- Decrease lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils / increase neutrophils, RBCs, platelets
- Promote gastric acid and pepsin secretion, inhibit mucus secretion → reduce gastric mucosal resistance
- Increase blood glucose → promote normal cellular metabolism
- Inhibit prostaglandins → reduce pain
- Stress response: maintain internal environment homeostasis
