# Chapter 02. Cell and Tissue

## 1. Cell

### Overview
- **Definition**: The human body is composed of approximately 75 trillion cells, the basic units of life.
- Cells are the units of structure, function, and heredity of living organisms.
- Cells of higher animals are highly differentiated, with many diverse types and distinct primary functions.

### Cell Membrane
- **Definition**: A membrane covering the cell surface, approximately 7.5–10 nm thick.
- **Functions**:
  - Acts as a physical barrier separating cell interior from extracellular fluid
  - Passage for metabolic and growth-related substances
  - Receives information from extracellular events (hormones, nerve excitation)
  - Recognition of other cells
  - Contains enzymes such as ATPase that activates Na⁺-K⁺ pump for active transport of Na⁺

### Composition of the Cell Membrane
- **Membrane Lipids**:
  - Phospholipid: 60–70% of total lipids; amphipathic molecules; barrier to water and ions; allows free passage of O₂ and CO₂; source of arachidonic acid
  - Cholesterol: 25% of lipids; regulates membrane fluidity; higher amounts decrease fluidity
  - Glycolipid: forms binding sites for hormones on the carbohydrate portion of the membrane
- **Membrane Proteins**:
  - Peripheral (extrinsic) protein: not amphipathic, located on membrane surface
  - Integral (intrinsic) protein: 70% of membrane proteins; forms carriers and channels; also called transmembrane proteins
- **Membrane Carbohydrates**: 2–10% of membrane weight; form glycoproteins or glycolipids; important in cell-to-cell recognition

### Structure of the Cell Membrane
- Thickness: 7.5–10 nm, three-layered structure
  - Inner and outer layers: ~2.0 nm each
  - Middle layer: ~3.5 nm
- Outer layer: protein-carbohydrate complex; inner layer: protein; middle layer: phospholipid

### Nucleus
- **Definition**: Control center for metabolism, protein synthesis, growth, and division; information center for genes
- Generally one nucleus per cell; skeletal muscle cells have multiple nuclei; RBCs and platelets lack nuclei
- **Nuclear membrane**: separates nucleus from cytoplasm; nuclear pores 50–70 nm diameter
- **Nucleolus**: composed of RNA and protein; synthesizes various RNAs
- **Chromosomes**: contain ~5 million genes' worth of DNA; somatic cells: 46, germ cells: 23

## Nucleic Acids

### DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- Constitutes genes; contains information for amino acid sequence and self-replication
- Pentose sugar: deoxyribose; double-stranded double helix structure
- Purine bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) / Pyrimidine bases: cytosine (C), thymine (T)
- Complementary base pairing: A-T, G-C
- Human genome: 3.3 trillion base pairs

### RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
- Transcribed from DNA; single-stranded structure
- Differs from DNA: ① ribose instead of deoxyribose ② uracil instead of thymine ③ single polynucleotide
- Types: mRNA (messenger), tRNA (transfer), rRNA (ribosomal)

### ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)
- Primary energy carrier in cells; adenosine (adenine + ribose) + 3 phosphate groups
- One glucose molecule produces 36 ATP molecules
- ATP → ADP + Pi releases energy via hydrolysis
- Also called the cell's "energy currency"

## Cytoplasm and Organelles

### Mitochondria
- Synthesize and supply ATP; the cell's "power factory"
- Size: 2–5 μm; 10–100 per cell; contain respiratory enzymes
- Glycolysis → transition reaction → Krebs cycle → electron transport chain (total 36 ATP)

### Lysosome
- Formed from Golgi apparatus; diameter 1.25–1.5 μm; contains powerful digestive enzymes
- Breaks down proteins, DNA, RNA, polysaccharides → recycled for new cell structures
- Abundant in WBCs and macrophages
- Site of cellular defense mechanisms

### Golgi Apparatus
- Stacked flattened membrane sacs + surrounding vesicles and vacuoles
- Abundant in secreting cells; closely related to secretory function
- Functions: concentrates and exports materials from ER; synthesizes glycoproteins, mucus, and sugars

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
- **Rough ER (rER)**: ribosomes attached; intracellular transport + protein synthesis
- **Smooth ER (sER)**: lipid metabolism, steroid synthesis, detoxification of toxic substances

### Centrosome
- Functions during cell division; typically a pair; length 300–500 nm, diameter 150 nm

### Ribosome
- Protein synthesis machinery; rich in RNA
- Free ribosomes: more abundant in actively dividing cells
- Membrane-bound ribosomes: synthesize membrane proteins and secretory proteins

### Peroxisome
- Size: 0.4–1.3 mm; abundant in liver and kidney cells
- Breaks down H₂O₂ into H₂O and O₂; bactericidal action in WBCs; removes toxic peroxides

### Fibril
- Tonofibrils: epithelial cells
- Myofibrils: muscle cells
- Neurofibrils: nerve cells

## Cell Division

### Mitosis
- Mother cell divides into 2 daughter cells with identical chromosomes
- **Interphase**: G₁ (growth 1) → S (synthesis) → G₂ (growth 2)
- **Prophase**: centrioles separate, spindle fibers form, chromatin → chromosomes, nuclear membrane and nucleolus disappear
- **Metaphase**: chromosomes align at equatorial plane
- **Anaphase**: chromosomes split longitudinally, move to opposite poles, cell constricts at center
- **Telophase**: chromatin reforms, nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, 2 independent cells form

### Meiosis
- Division during maturation of germ cells
- Chromosome number reduced from 46 to 23 (haploid number)
- Sperm: 22+Y or 22+X; ovum: 22+X
- Crossing over of homologous chromosomes occurs

## Substance Transport

### Passive (Physical) Transport
- **Simple diffusion**: molecules move from high to low concentration along the concentration gradient
- **Facilitated diffusion**: passive movement via carrier proteins; no energy required
- **Osmosis**: movement of water through a semipermeable membrane
  - Isotonic solution: 0.9% NaCl (physiological saline); no change in cell size
  - Hypotonic solution: cell swells; osmotic hemolysis
  - Hypertonic solution: cell shrinks; dehydration (crenation)
- **Filtration**: fluid movement due to pressure difference; capillary-tissue exchange, glomerular filtration

### Active (Physiological) Transport
- **Active transport**: uses cell energy; moves substances from low to high concentration
  - Na⁺-K⁺ pump: exports 3Na⁺, imports 2K⁺
- **Endocytosis**: pinocytosis, phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis
- **Exocytosis**: vesicles fuse with membrane to release contents

## 2. Tissue

### Types of Tissue
- Four basic types: epithelial, connective, muscle, nervous
- Epithelial: protection, secretion, absorption, excretion (covering)
- Connective: binding, support, protection, fat storage, blood cell production (support)
