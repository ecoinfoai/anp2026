# Chapter 08. Respiratory System

## 1. Structure and Function of Respiratory Organs

### Definition of Respiration
- **Respiration**: The entire process of inhaling oxygen from the outside, transporting it to cells, and exhaling CO₂ produced by cellular metabolism
- **External respiration**: Gas exchange (O₂ in, CO₂ out) between pulmonary blood vessels and alveoli
- **Internal respiration**: Gas exchange between capillary blood and tissue cells

### Upper Airway — Nose
- The nose is a triangular-conical projection at the center of the face
- Nostrils (external nares) are the openings for air to enter the nasal cavity
- Nasal hair (vibrissae) filters large airborne particles and dust

### Upper Airway — Nasal Cavity
- The nasal cavity is the hollow space behind the nose, divided left and right by the nasal septum
- Separated from the cranial cavity by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone; separated from oral cavity by the hard palate
- Three nasal conchae (superior, middle, inferior) on the lateral wall create meatuses (superior, middle, inferior)
- Conchae generate swirling airflow → centrifugal force deposits dust on nasal mucosa
- Anterior floor: hard palate (bone-supported); posterior: soft palate (no bone)

### Upper Airway — Paranasal Sinuses
- Paranasal sinuses surround the nasal cavity in a ring-like pattern
- **Components**: frontal sinus, sphenoid sinus, ethmoid sinus, maxillary sinus
- **Sphenoid sinus**: inside sphenoid body above nasal cavity, opens into superior meatus
- **Ethmoid sinus**: 3–15 small cavities in ethmoid bone, opens into superior and middle meatuses
- **Frontal sinus**: paired cavities in frontal bone, opens via semilunar hiatus into middle meatus
- **Maxillary sinus**: largest paranasal sinus in maxillary body; most prone to sinusitis

### Upper Airway — Pharynx
- Pharynx: ~13 cm funnel-shaped fibromuscular tube where digestive tract and airway intersect
- Located behind nasal/oral cavities and larynx, anterior to cervical vertebrae
- Air pathway: nasal cavity → nasopharynx → oropharynx → laryngopharynx → larynx

### Lower Airway — Larynx
- Larynx (voice box): routes air to trachea, food to esophagus, and aids phonation
- Composed of 8 hyaline cartilages + 1 elastic cartilage (epiglottis); located at C4–C6 level
- **Laryngeal cavity**: divided into 3 parts by vestibular folds and vocal folds
- **Glottis**: space between left and right vocal folds
- **Phonation**: vocal muscles narrow the glottis; forced air vibrates to produce sound
- Vestibular folds (false vocal cords): not directly involved in phonation; add moisture to air
- **Sex differences**: male vocal cords 13 mm, female 10 mm; males have laryngeal prominence (Adam's apple)
- **Laryngeal cartilages**: 3 large (thyroid, cricoid, epiglottic) + 3 pairs of small (arytenoid, cuneiform, corniculate)
  - Thyroid cartilage: largest laryngeal cartilage, shield-shaped
  - Cricoid cartilage: ring-shaped, connects thyroid cartilage above to first tracheal ring below
  - Epiglottic cartilage: tennis racket-shaped; covers laryngeal inlet during swallowing
  - Arytenoid cartilage: pyramid-shaped, adjusts vocal cord position and tension for phonation

### Lower Airway — Trachea
- Trachea: ~2.5 cm diameter, ~10–12 cm length, from larynx to tracheal bifurcation
- Descends from C7 to T5, anterior to esophagus
- Lined with ciliated mucosa that moves mucus from lungs toward pharynx
- Composed of 15–20 C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings
  - Open side: allows esophageal expansion during swallowing
  - Rigid side: maintains airway patency during pressure changes

### Lower Airway — Bronchi
- At the tracheal bifurcation, left and right primary bronchi form
- **Primary bronchi**: right is shorter, wider, more vertical than left → foreign objects more likely to enter right side
- **Secondary bronchi (lobar)**: right 3, left 2 — matches number of lung lobes
- **Tertiary bronchi (segmental)**: right ~10, left ~8
- **Bronchioles**: diameter <1 mm
- **Terminal bronchioles**: conducting airway, 50–80 per lobule
- **Respiratory bronchioles**: ~0.5 mm diameter, have alveoli attached → participate in gas exchange
- **Alveolar ducts**: 2–10 small tubes from respiratory bronchioles
- **Alveolar sacs**: thin-walled pouch structures

### Lungs
- Lungs: paired semi-conical solid organs filling the thoracic cavity
- Volume: right 1,200 cc, left 1,000 cc; weight: right 600 g, left 500 g (ratio 10:9)
- Covered by pleura
- **Apex**: extends 2–3 cm above clavicle
- **Base**: rests on diaphragm
- **Hilum**: entry/exit point for bronchi, pulmonary arteries, bronchial vessels, lymphatics, nerves
- **Right lung**: 3 lobes (upper, middle, lower) — oblique fissure + horizontal fissure
- **Left lung**: 2 lobes (upper, lower) — oblique fissure

### Alveoli
- Alveoli: thin-walled air sacs, ~300–500 million in number
- Gas exchange surface area: ~70–100 m²
- **Type I pneumocytes**: cover 95% of alveolar surface, thin and broad for gas exchange
- **Type II pneumocytes (septal cells)**: secrete surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse during expiration
- **Dust cells (alveolar macrophages)**: phagocytize dust and foreign particles

### Functions of the Lungs
- ① Secrete surfactant
- ② Secrete kinin (vasodilation)
- ③ Secrete gastrin (stomach hormone)
- ④ Convert angiotensin I → angiotensin II
- ⑤ Synthesize, store, release prostaglandin; involved in insulin metabolism — all via pulmonary capillary endothelium

### Mediastinum
- Mediastinum: central thoracic space between left and right lungs
- Boundaries: mediastinal pleura (lateral), sternum (anterior), vertebral column (posterior), diaphragm (inferior)
- **Superior**: trachea, esophagus, thymus, aorta, superior vena cava
- **Anterior**: thymus, internal thoracic artery/vein
- **Middle**: heart
- **Posterior**: esophagus, vagus nerve, aorta, thoracic duct

## 2. Respiratory Physiology

### Respiratory Mechanics — Inspiration
- Inspiration is an **active** process requiring muscle contraction and energy expenditure
- **Diaphragm contraction**: phrenic nerve (C₃–C₅) stimulation → diaphragm descends → intrathoracic pressure drops to -2.5 to -6 mmHg → alveoli expand, volume increases ~250–300 ml. Diaphragmatic breathing = abdominal breathing (more common in males)
- **External intercostal muscle contraction**: ribs elevate → thorax expands → intrathoracic pressure drops → alveoli expand. External intercostals + erector spinae = thoracic breathing
- **Abdominal muscle relaxation**: assists diaphragm descent
- **Surfactant reduces surface tension**: surfactant (lipoprotein) reduces alveolar surface tension → facilitates expansion

### Respiratory Mechanics — Expiration
- Expiration is a **passive** process (reverse of inspiration), requires no energy
- Primary muscle: internal intercostal muscle

### Lung Volumes and Capacities
- **Tidal volume (TV)**: air inhaled/exhaled per normal breath = 500 ml
- **Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)**: additional air that can be inhaled after normal inspiration = 3,100 ml
- **Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)**: additional air that can be exhaled after normal expiration = 1,200 ml
- **Residual volume (RV)**: air remaining after maximal expiration = 1,200 ml (20% of TLC; ≥35% suggests dysfunction)
- **Inspiratory capacity (IC)** = IRV + TV = 3,600 ml
- **Functional residual capacity (FRC)** = RV + ERV = 2,400 ml
- **Vital capacity (VC)** = IC + ERV = 4,800 ml (decreases significantly after age 40)
- **Total lung capacity (TLC)** = VC + RV = 6,000 ml
- **Dead space**: ~150 ml of air that stays in conducting airways without reaching alveoli

### Alveolar Gas Exchange
- Atmospheric composition: N₂ 78.97%, O₂ 21%, CO₂ 0.03%
- At 760 mmHg: N₂ 600, O₂ 159, CO₂ 0.3 mmHg
- Alveolar air: O₂ ~100, CO₂ ~40, water vapor 47, N₂ 573 mmHg
- Arterial blood: O₂ ~95 (some sources 100), CO₂ ~40 mmHg
- Venous blood (pulmonary): O₂ ~40, CO₂ ~46 mmHg

### Oxygen Transport by Blood
- Most O₂ is chemically bound to hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin); only ~1% is physically dissolved
- Oxygen saturation increases as O₂ partial pressure rises, approaching 100%
- **Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve**: shifts right when CO₂ partial pressure increases → at same O₂ level, higher CO₂ means lower O₂ saturation

### Carbon Dioxide Transport by Blood
- Most CO₂ transport is chemical (physical dissolution is minimal)
- **~80%**: as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) in plasma
- **~20%**: as carbaminohemoglobin (bound to hemoglobin)

### Neural Control of Respiration
- **Respiratory center**: spans from medulla oblongata to pons
  - Medulla: controls respiratory rhythm
  - Pons: controls respiratory rate
- **Hering-Breuer reflex**: vagus nerve-mediated reflex that provides rhythmicity to respiration
- Cerebral cortex can override automatic mechanisms to some extent (e.g., singing, blowing a balloon)

### Chemical Control of Respiration
- Blood CO₂ affects excitability of respiratory center
- **Peripheral chemoreceptors**: carotid body (at internal carotid bifurcation) and aortic body (at aortic arch) — detect ↑CO₂ or ↓O₂ → increase respiratory center excitability → more vigorous breathing
- Respiratory center itself is directly excited by CO₂ → increased CO₂ deepens and accelerates breathing

### Abnormal Breathing Patterns
- **Tachypnea**: increased respiratory rate
- **Dyspnea**: difficult/labored breathing — causes include airway resistance (asthma), fluid accumulation (peritonitis, pleuritis), impaired gas exchange (pneumonia)
- **Cheyne-Stokes respiration**: cyclical pattern of weak/absent breathing → gradually increasing → gradually decreasing → apnea — seen in CNS disorders, heart failure, uremia, narcotic poisoning, near death
- **Kussmaul respiration**: deep, slow continuous breathing — seen in severe metabolic acidosis (diabetes, renal failure) with coma
- **Biot respiration**: irregular deep breaths interspersed with apnea/shallow breathing — seen in intracranial hypertension with encephalitis, meningitis, brain tumors
