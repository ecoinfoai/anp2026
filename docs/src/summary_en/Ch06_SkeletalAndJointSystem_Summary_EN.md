# Chapter 06. Skeletal and Joint System

## 1. Skeleton

The skeleton consists of approximately 206 bones and cartilage. Most bones are functionally connected by connective tissues such as ligaments, enabling joint movement.

### Functions of the Skeleton
- **Supporting**: Acts as a firm framework, determines external body structure
- **Protection**: Protects brain (cranial cavity), spinal cord (spinal canal), heart/lungs (thoracic cavity), bladder/uterus (pelvic cavity)
- **Leverage**: Attached muscles contract to produce movement via lever action
- **Hemopoiesis**: Red bone marrow produces red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells
- **Storage of mineral salts**: Stores calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphorus (P)
- **Air spaces**: Cavities in some skull bones reduce weight and contribute to sound resonance

### Classification of Bones
- **Long bone**: Hollow tubular structure with medullary cavity, epiphysis at both ends, diaphysis in the middle — e.g., humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula
- **Short bone**: Cube-shaped with similar width and length, no medullary cavity — e.g., carpal bones, tarsal bones
- **Flat bone**: Broad plate shape with outer layer, inner layer, and diploe containing red bone marrow — e.g., frontal, parietal, occipital, scapula, ribs, sternum
- **Irregular bone**: Various shapes — e.g., vertebrae, zygomatic bones
- **Air bone**: Contains air spaces within — e.g., frontal, maxilla, sphenoid, ethmoid, temporal
- **Sesamoid bone**: Small seed-shaped bone within tendons — e.g., patella

### Bone Structure
- **Compact bone**: Outer layer filled with bone matrix
  - **Osteon (Haversian system)**: Composed of lacunae, osteocytes, canaliculi, central canal (Haversian canal) with blood vessels, and lamellae
  - **Volkmann's canal (perforating canal)**: Connects blood vessels in Haversian canals horizontally
- **Spongy bone**: Inner layer with porous structure
  - **Trabeculae**: Branching small pillars
  - **Medullary cavity**: Filled with bone marrow

### Types of Bone Marrow
- **Red bone marrow**: Hematopoietic function; in adults found in epiphyses of long bones, short bones, flat bone spongy tissue; mainly in sternum, skull, clavicle, hip bones, vertebrae, and parts of femur/humerus
- **Yellow bone marrow**: Red marrow replaced by fat; found in adult long bone diaphysis; retains latent activity
- **Gelatinous bone marrow**: Found in elderly or patients with chronic wasting diseases; converted to gelatin

### Membranes Covering Bone
- **Periosteum**: Double-layered membrane covering all bone surfaces except articular surfaces — outer fibrous layer and inner osteogenic layer (with osteoblasts and osteoclasts), attached by Sharpey's fibers; involved in protection, circumferential growth, and regeneration
- **Endosteum**: Delicate connective tissue membrane covering trabeculae and medullary cavities; contains osteoblasts and osteoclasts

### Bone Components
- **Osteoblast**: Produces bone matrix, involved in bone formation
- **Osteocyte**: Mature bone cell located in lacunae
- **Osteoclast**: Large multinucleated cell that resorbs bone tissue to create medullary cavities, blood vessel and nerve passages
- **Intercellular matrix**: Collagen (provides elasticity), calcium (65% of bone weight), calcium phosphate (~85%), calcium carbonate (~10%)

### Ossification and Growth
- **Intramembranous ossification**: Fibrous connective tissue membrane directly converts to bone — skull bones, some facial bones
- **Endochondral ossification**: Hyaline cartilage is replaced by bone — most bones
- Clavicle undergoes the earliest ossification in the body
- **Epiphyseal plate**: Responsible for longitudinal growth; becomes epiphyseal line when growth is complete
- **Periosteum**: Responsible for thickness growth

## 2. Axial Skeleton

The axial skeleton consists of skull bones, vertebrae, sternum, and ribs.

- **Hyoid bone**: U-shaped; the only bone that does not articulate with any other bone

### Paranasal Sinuses
- Frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, maxillary sinuses — lighten skull weight, enhance sound resonance

### Sutures and Fontanelles
- **Sutures**: Coronal, sagittal, squamous, lambdoid

### Thoracic Cage
- 12 thoracic vertebrae, 12 pairs of ribs, 1 sternum
- **True ribs** (1-7): Directly connected to sternum
- **False ribs** (8-12): Not directly connected
- **Floating ribs** (11-12): Articulate only with thoracic vertebral bodies

## 4. Joints

Joints bind bones tightly together while allowing the rigid skeleton to move.

### Types of Joint Connections

#### Fibrous Joints
- **Sutures**: Immovable joints between skull bones
- **Syndesmosis**: Slightly flexible connection by interosseous ligament — e.g., tibiofibular joint
- **Gomphosis**: Peg-in-socket joint — e.g., tooth roots in alveoli

#### Cartilaginous Joints
- **Fibrocartilaginous joint (amphiarthrosis)**: Slight movement — e.g., pubic symphysis, intervertebral joints
- **Hyaline cartilage joint**: Epiphyseal plate, costal cartilage

#### Synovial Joints
- Greatest mobility; joint cavity contains synovial fluid
- **Articular capsule**: Outer fibrous membrane + inner synovial membrane

### Classification of Synovial Joints
- **Ball-and-socket joint**: Triaxial, greatest range of motion — e.g., shoulder joint, hip joint
- **Plane joint (gliding joint)**: Limited movement — e.g., intervertebral, intercarpal, sacroiliac joints
- **Hinge joint**: Flexion and extension — e.g., knee, elbow, ankle joints
- **Pivot joint**: Rotation around long axis — e.g., proximal/distal radioulnar joints
- **Condyloid joint**: Biaxial movement — e.g., radiocarpal, metacarpophalangeal joints
- **Saddle joint**: Saddle-shaped articular surfaces — e.g., carpometacarpal joint of thumb

### Movements of Synovial Joints
- **Gliding**: Simplest movement; sliding between articular surfaces
- **Angular movements**: Flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction
- **Circumduction**: Distal end traces a circle — shoulder and hip joints
- **Rotation**: Medial and lateral rotation around long axis
- **Pronation**: Palm faces posteriorly / **Supination**: Palm faces anteriorly
- **Inversion**: Sole faces medially / **Eversion**: Sole faces laterally
- **Elevation/Depression**, **Opposition/Protraction/Retraction**

### Major Joints

- **Hip joint**: Ball-and-socket joint between acetabulum and femoral head
- **Knee joint**: Modified hinge joint between femur and tibia
