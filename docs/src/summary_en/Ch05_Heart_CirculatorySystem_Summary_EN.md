# Chapter 05. Heart & Circulatory System

## 1. Heart

### Overview of the Heart
- **Definition**: The heart is a muscular double pump — a hollow organ that sends venous blood to the lungs and pumps oxygenated arterial blood to all parts of the body
- **Location**: Within the thoracic cavity, enclosed in a double-layered pericardium; 2/3 positioned to the left of the midline
- **Size**: Weight ~250–300g, length ~14cm, width ~10cm, thickness ~8cm; slightly larger than one's own fist
- **Structural landmarks**:
  - Axis of the heart: the long axis
  - Base of the heart: the broad upper end
  - Apex of the heart: the pointed lower-left tip
  - Coronary groove: a transverse groove at the upper 1/3 carrying coronary vessels

### Internal Structure of the Heart
- **Right atrium**: Receives venous blood via superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC). SVC has no venous valves. Fossa ovalis on the interatrial septum is the remnant of the fetal foramen ovale
- **Right ventricle**: Contracts to send blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. Chordae tendineae connect to papillary muscles. Cone (conus) structure below the pulmonary artery opening. Semilunar valves prevent backflow
- **Left atrium**: Receives oxygenated blood from 4 pulmonary veins. Thin wall with left auricle
- **Left ventricle**: Wall thickness ~2cm, 3× the right ventricular wall. Ejects oxygenated blood to the body via the aorta. Bicuspid valve (mitral valve) regulates blood flow

### Heart Valves
- **Bicuspid valve**: Left AV orifice, 2 cusps, also called mitral valve
- **Tricuspid valve**: Right AV orifice, 3 cusps
- **Pulmonary valve**: At the pulmonary artery opening, prevents backflow during ventricular diastole
- **Aortic valve**: At the aortic opening, considerably larger than the pulmonary valve
- AV valves are anchored to papillary muscles by chordae tendineae

### Functional Characteristics of Cardiac Muscle
- Composed of nodal tissue, Purkinje fiber tissue, and striated muscle tissue
- **4 properties**: Rhythmicity, conductivity, contractility, excitability
- **3 layers of the heart wall**: Endocardium → Myocardium → Epicardium (pericardium)
- Cardiac muscle forms a functional syncytium

### Cardiac Conduction System
- SA node → AV node → AV bundle → Left & right bundle branches → Purkinje fibers → Ventricular muscle contraction
- Cardiac pulse: rhythmic contraction of the heart
- Cardiac cycle: ~0.8 seconds at rest
- Electrocardiogram (EKG): graphic recording of the electrical activity of cardiac muscle

## 2. Blood Vessels

### Structure of Blood Vessels
- 3-layer structure: **Tunica intima** (inner), **Tunica media** (middle), **Tunica adventitia** (outer)
- Tunica intima: lined with a single layer of endothelial cells
- Tunica media: the thickest layer, smooth muscle fibers and elastic fibers
- Tunica adventitia: mainly connective tissue with small amounts of muscle fibers

### Types of Blood Vessels
- **Arteries**: Thicker than veins, maintain high perfusion pressure. Thick tunica media maintains shape even without blood
- **Veins**: Thinner walls, less elastic. Venous valves prevent backflow. Serve as blood reservoirs
- **Capillaries**: Connect arterioles and venules, diameter 7–10μm. Composed only of endothelial tunica intima. All fluid components except proteins can pass through

### Pulmonary Circulation
- Lesser circulation: Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium
- Pulmonary artery carries venous blood (high CO₂, low O₂)
- Pulmonary veins carry arterial blood

## 3. Systemic Arterial Circulation

### Aorta
- Left ventricle → Ascending aorta → Aortic arch → Descending aorta
- Descending aorta: Thoracic aorta (above diaphragm) and Abdominal aorta (below diaphragm)

### Branches of the Aortic Arch
- **Brachiocephalic trunk**: Branches into right common carotid artery and right subclavian artery
- **Left common carotid artery**, **Left subclavian artery** — 3 branches total

### Carotid Sinus, Carotid Body, Aortic Body
- **Carotid sinus**: Dilated portion at the start of the internal carotid artery; baroreceptor — when blood pressure rises, heart rate decreases
- **Carotid body**: Chemoreceptor at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery; monitors blood O₂ levels, assists respiratory regulation
- **Aortic body**: Chemoreceptor beside the aorta; responds to increased CO₂ partial pressure and decreased pH

### Circle of Willis
- Cerebral arterial circle formed by internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries at the base of the brain
- Composed of: anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, posterior cerebral arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating arteries

## 4. Venous System

### Cardiac Veins
- Coronary veins → Coronary sinus → Right atrium

### Superior Vena Cava
- Drains blood from head, neck, upper limbs, and thorax
- Formed by the union of left and right brachiocephalic veins
- Diameter ~2cm, the second largest vein after the IVC

### Inferior Vena Cava
- The largest vein in the body
- Parietal branches: lumbar veins (4 pairs), inferior phrenic vein
- Visceral branches: renal veins, suprarenal veins, gonadal veins, hepatic veins

### Portal Vein
- Formed from venous blood of the stomach, intestines, pancreas, spleen, and gallbladder
- Passes through hepatic sinusoids → hepatic veins → IVC
- The only blood in the body that passes through capillaries twice

## 5. Fetal Circulation

### Prenatal Circulation
- **Umbilical vein**: Delivers oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood from the placenta to the fetus
- **Umbilical arteries**: A pair of vessels carrying fetal venous blood to the placenta
- **Foramen ovale**: Opening in the interatrial septum, shunts blood from right to left atrium
- **Ductus arteriosus**: Connects pulmonary artery to the aortic arch
- **Ductus venosus**: Connects the umbilical vein to the IVC

### Postnatal Remnants
- Foramen ovale → Fossa ovalis
- Ductus arteriosus → Ligamentum arteriosum
- Umbilical arteries → Medial umbilical ligaments
- Umbilical vein → Round ligament (ligamentum teres)
- Ductus venosus → Ligamentum venosum

## 6. Cardiac Function

### Electrocardiogram (EKG) Waveforms
- **P wave**: Atrial depolarization
- **QRS complex**: Ventricular depolarization, ~0.08 seconds duration
- **T wave**: Ventricular repolarization, ~0.27 seconds duration
- **P-Q interval**: Time for impulse to travel from SA node to AV node
- **S-T segment**: Period of sustained ventricular repolarization

### Heart Sounds
- First heart sound (S1): Closure of AV valves (mitral & tricuspid); low-pitched, dull
- Second heart sound (S2): Closure of aortic and pulmonary valves; high-pitched, sharp
- Heart murmurs: Abnormal sounds due to valve dysfunction

### Cardiac Cycle
- Systole + Diastole = Cardiac cycle (~0.8 seconds)
- Atrial systole 0.11s, Ventricular systole 0.27s, Ventricular diastole 0.42s
- Starling's law of the heart: Ventricular contractile force increases with filling volume; independent of the nervous system

### Cardiac Output
- Heart rate at rest: ~70–80 beats/min
- Stroke volume at rest: ~70mL
- Cardiac output per minute: ~5L (70mL × 70 beats/min)

### Cardiac Nerves and Reflexes
- **Sympathetic nerve**: Increases heart rate, strengthens contraction, accelerates conduction
- **Parasympathetic nerve (vagus nerve)**: Decreases heart rate, weakens contraction, slows conduction
- **Bainbridge reflex**: Increased venous pressure → increased heart rate
- **Aortic arch & carotid sinus reflex**: Blood pressure rise → baroreceptor activation → decreased heart rate
- **Carotid body reflex**: Increased CO₂ detected → increased heart rate
- **Aschner reflex (oculocardiac reflex)**: Eye pressure → stimulates cardiac inhibitory center → suppresses cardiac activity

## 7. Blood Pressure

### Blood Pressure
- Blood pressure (BP): Pressure within blood vessels; highest near the heart, nearly zero in the great veins
- Systolic pressure (maximum) and Diastolic pressure (minimum)
- **Pulse pressure**: Systolic – Diastolic, normally ~1/3 of systolic pressure
- Normal BP (ages 20–30): Systolic ~120mmHg, Diastolic ~80mmHg

### Blood Pressure Measurement
- Typically measured at the brachial artery
- Mercury sphygmomanometer: cuff + stethoscope → Korotkoff sounds
- Arterial pulse: usually palpated at the radial artery

### Regulation of Vascular Tone
- **Neural regulation**: Sympathetic (vasoconstriction, ↑BP) + Parasympathetic (vasodilation, ↓BP) = Vasomotor nerves
- **Chemical regulation**: CO₂ and lactic acid → vasodilation; Adrenaline → vasoconstriction; Histamine → vasodilation
- **Humoral regulation**: Renin-angiotensin system → Angiotensin II → vasoconstriction + aldosterone secretion → ↑Na⁺ reabsorption → ↑blood volume → ↑BP

## 8. Lymphatic System

### Lymphatic Vessels
- Lymphatic capillaries → Lymph vessels → Right lymphatic duct + Thoracic duct → Venous angle at the junction of subclavian and inferior vena cava
- Thoracic duct: Collects lymph from entire body except upper right quadrant, length ~40cm, diameter 3–4mm

### Lymph Nodes
- Diameter 2–30mm, oval-shaped; lymph enters via afferent lymph vessels and exits via efferent lymph vessels
- **Functions**: ① Filtration and phagocytosis ② Lymphocyte production ③ Antibody formation

### Spleen
- Location: Upper left abdomen, behind left 8th–11th ribs; weight ~170g
- **White pulp**: Contains B cells and T cells; antibody production and immune responses
- **Red pulp**: Blood storage, regulation of circulating blood volume, phagocytosis of aged red blood cells

### Thymus
- Located in the mediastinum, anterior to the aortic arch, posterior to the upper sternum
- Relatively larger in childhood (25–30g), shrinks after puberty (10–15g)
- Secretes thymosins → T cell maturation
- Hassall's corpuscle (thymic corpuscle): keratinized epithelial cells in the medulla

### Tonsils
- Aggregates of lymph nodules; protect the entrances of the digestive and respiratory systems from bacteria
- **Palatine tonsil**: Deep in the oral cavity
- **Pharyngeal tonsil**: On the roof of the pharynx
- **Lingual tonsil**: On the mucosa of the tongue
- Waldeyer's tonsil ring: Circular arrangement of all three tonsils
